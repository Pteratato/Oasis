## Chapter 5: The Preliminaries

The hunter breathed in the damp scent of the underground, perspiration beading on his forehead. Hahn’s fingers twitched with the sensation of insects skittering beneath his skin, and he shook his hands to relieve the discomfort, shifting his weight back and forth from one foot to the other. His heart thumped in his chest with unusual fervor, and the sweat on his brow rolled down his face despite the chill. He jerked his head and shoulders periodically to combat the creeping things infecting his nervous system, and forced his brain and his senses to *focus*. What did he know?

*He was underground.*

Even in the blackness there was no mistaking subterranean air; cool, damp, and stagnant. There was no salt taste in the air, however, reassuring him that he hadn't been betrayed.

*He was naked, but not shackled.*

Although there were heavy belts around his wrists for that purpose, his containment for the moment seemed to be this… very small room… and they had taken his clothes, and of course his effects, but he couldn’t recall it. They had drugged him, he was sure of it, and whether or not he deserved it, well he couldn’t recall that, either. The chemical sluggishness clung stubbornly to his thoughts, weighing them down.

*His body was detoxing, too.*

“Impeccable fucking timing, as always,” he muttered at the thought, moving about restlessly. He’d known, of course, that this would come. It always came eventually -- the black snake writhing in his gut was as familiar as the salt of thoralite -- but this time he wouldn’t be able to haggle for a bit of dust to cut the edge. There was dread in him now, but also something else -- *relief*. This was truly the pivotal moment, when the Wheel turned in a new direction. All of his comforts, such as they had been, were gone now. And there was no going back, he knew. He felt it in his bones; the simple life he’d been building in the Sprawl with his family, with his kin, was gone forever.

Strangely, he didn’t mourn it. 

*He wasn't alone.*

He could hear others in the distance. Spread out. He tried to focus on the scuffles and the sounds, but his brain remained stubbornly clouded by... sedation, perhaps, or withdrawal, or both. His ears picked up the noises but his mind seemed unable or unwilling to interpret them. 

*And he really, really needed to take a piss.*

Hahn shifted back and forth from one leg to the other to relieve the unpleasant discomfort, which was a minor, nagging sensation compared to the others. He shook his head as if that would chase the fog from his brain, and tried to recall how he’d gotten here, how long he’d been here, or any thread of memory at all. But the last thing he remembered was scuffling with HAREs outside of the Outer Wall.

“*Fuckers*,” he cursed, and set his faculties back to his current predicament.

“Alright, let’s see…” he mumbled to himself under his breath, still moving back and forth from one leg to the other. He cast his eyes around the claustrophobic darkness, his senses unable to penetrate the black veil, his mind clouded with fog, and mouthed the words of an old mining song.

*Beneath the violet quarry*
*We pick away, pick away*
*Far from the light*
*We dig away, dig away*
*Towards the Blind One*
*We pray for hope, pray for hope*
*Where even God cannot see*
*No, even God cannot see*

He repeated this in a loop and forced some clarity into his brain. *They* had pulled him up, put him here, he recalled, in some kind of box. He turned around in a full circle, touching the stone walls, cool and moist. The dimensions reminded him of an outhouse in the Sprawl, although it did not have a latrine, depressingly. Two of the sides were wooden doors, opposite each other, and he knocked on them to get a sense of the thickness. Heavy.

He rested his head against one damp, stone wall, listening. He closed his eyes, little difference as that made in the blackness of the space, and forced his heart to slow. The stone muffled most sound, but he could hear others, perhaps even many others, and he suspected they were contained as he was contained. There was nothing that sounded like language, just scuffling, coughing, banging...

Someone shouted and it echoed eerily. A deep voice responded by yelling, “Shut up over there!”

Ahh, so they were in a large space, then. Well, small spaces set inside a larger space. Personal little outhouses. He wondered if they were all naked or if he was just special. 

“Welcome, combatantsss!” a magnified voice boomed from the darkness beyond Hahn’s little cell, “to the bicentennial preliminary contesst of sstrength and wit, where you sshall match skillss with fourscore fellow bloodthirsty hopefulss in a bid for a sslot in the official Octavian games!”

A riotous uproar broke out as the contained fighters thrashed and banged against their cells, shouting and jeering and whooping in anticipation. Hahn’s breath quickened and his eyes sharpened at the energy in the air, but he didn’t participate in the wild exertion. He attempted again to recall how he’d arrived here, but through the haziness of his mind and the demand of the current moment, discarded that effort as momentarily inconsequential.


“Mediate for a moment, if you pleasse, on your reasonss for engaging in thiss tournament of ssweat and blood, on the tasste of the Holy Grail at the end of the sstruggle, when you sstand atop the bodiess of your adversariess in victory. Only one may rise and collect that glory and the prize that accompaniess…”

*Shit, this guy talks too much.* Hahn shifted back and forth, opening and closing his fists.

“...and sso face the battle royale before you with courage and sstamina as the first of many trialss. You will find, at the centermost point in the arena, a variety of bludgeoning objectss, with which you may fell your fellowss. But bear in mind Octavian Ordinance eighty-five, which leviess a penalty on any fighter who landss a fatal blow; thiss game is one of incapacitation, not death. Excessive agression may, in fact, incur penaltiess ssuch as fines and even dissqualification…”

Hahn groaned, casting his eyes towards the ceiling of his cell in disbelief. He hadn’t expected Octavian bleeding heart nonsense to extend all the way to fucking *bloodsports*, but that was just like them.

An overlapping cacophony of great, mechanical grinding erupted next, screeching and echoing oddly, bouncing around the open spaces and closed spaces as if trying to escape. The prisoners, too, exploded into a wild fury, banging and howling like wolves, exhaling adrenaline and anticipation. The wooden doors of the cells started grinding downwards, sliding into the stone floor, but they stopped halfway to prevent the fighters from leaving their cubbies. Simultaneously, the ceiling opened up and spilled a great flood of light into the underground arena.

The ceiling unfurled like a giant flower of converging slats, forming a kaleidoscopic heptagonal pattern as the panels slid back into each other with a churning, scraping ruckus. The geometric retraction was mesmerizing, and Hahn couldn’t look away despite the uncomfortable brightness of the light above. He thought, for a moment, it was the sun up there.

It wasn’t the sun, but an additional floor above them. The panels folded away, revealing a glass ceiling, and the electric light spilling in came from a great chandelier above. The glass ceiling above the underground arena was a glass *floor* to the storey above, and it was scattered with people, their attention also drawn to the room revealed. 

No sound penetrated from the room above, but Hahn’s keen eyes could see them clearly. Those people up there were extravagantly attired -- trousered, of course, even the women -- and bejeweled, and there was no mistaking the bright peacockery of aristocratic society. They were enjoying some kind of grand ball, and even in his little outhouse in the underground arena, Hahn could see the cups of wine, the little plates of food, and even the children darting back and forth between the legs of adults in a game of tag.

Ahh, so they were the evening’s entertainment.

With the light pouring down, he could see a whole perimeter of identical cells circling the arena, every other one housing a fighter, many of them now banging and carrying on. The arena itself was an unremarkable open pit with racks of bludgeoning clubs in the center, just as their commentator had described. He spied two sets of studded double-doors breaking up the circumference of cells, but he knew his path out of this place was set.

“Ready, fighterss…!”

With the geometric panels of the ceiling in full retraction, the cell doors resumed grinding into the floor, until all of the doors locked into place and the combatants were unleashed. Truly remarkable was the array of bodies that poured into the arena, all naked, running the gamut from pale to dark, male to female, lithe to muscular, and smooth to furred. They rushed into the center to grapple for weapons, many getting entangled in conflict along the way.

Clubs were good, but not *that* good.

Hahn emerged slowly, fists raised, and he spied others across the arena who were hanging back, waiting. He even saw one human male give another a friendly wave and smile, as if this were just some Tuesday afternoon at the market. Those people were his real opponents, Hahn realized. 

He didn’t have much time to ponder this as a duo of fighters charged at him, squat bats spiked with nails in hand. One was a thick human male, and the other a greater canid with desert coloration, fierce teeth, and the wild eyes of a jackal. The therianthrope rushed him first and Hahn sidestep the swing, only to feel the nails of the human’s bat bite into his calf, ripping the flesh. Hahn cursed, hitting the ground and rolling just in time to avoid the jackal’s bat striking the floor.

The pair worked together, but they were uncoordinated and erratic. The nails scraped and sparked against the ground as Hahn dodged another pair of blows, one aiming for head and one for his knees. He landed a strong kick against the pair of human legs, causing the big fighter to recoil. With a bit of space now, Hahn hopped to his feet and was forced to jump back immediately to avoid the jackal’s swing, whistling a hair's width from his chest. Scarcely did his feet touch the floor before he sprang forward, shoulder rushing the body heavily into a wall and grappling for possession of the bat.

It was all a frenzy of body and fur and snarling teeth. Fangs bit deep into his shoulder, but Hahn didn’t let up. He kept the creature shouldered against the wall, his bare feet digging into the moist stone to find as much purchase as possible. His right hand squeezed the jackal’s neck, digging into its jugular, and the therianthrope dropped the bat, employing both clawed hands to rip at Hahn’s back. The teeth released him, now gasping desperately for air.

Hahn sensed the shadow of the human fall over them and instinctively ducked, an action that pulled the jackal’s head into the path of the weapon. Bludgeoned in the skull by his own partner, the jackal fell limp. Hahn let the body drop, strafing to grab up the discarded nail bat and pivoting to face the human.

The large man raged at the realization that he’d struck his friend. He called, casting glances towards the fallen body, and Hahn did not waste this momentary distraction.

Hahn launched forward, swinging hard. The large man lifted his arms to block the attack and stumbled backwards, uncoordinated. Hahn’s attack missed its mark but he came back again, and on the back swing landed a blow to the fighter’s knees. The man collapsed with a deep groan.

Hahn raised his bat again, standing over the man now, his eyes sharp with intent.

“Hold! Hold! Hold!” the man shouted pleadingly, his big hands lifting to block his face. “Penalty! Against the rules!”

This pleading managed to cut through the haze of adrenaline, and Hahn hesitated, staring down at the man below him. He then levied a second crushing blow to the man’s knee, and the opponent erupted into a howl of pain and curses. Hahn turned from him towards the fray, slick with sweat and bleeding profusely, but he was numb to it now, the black snake in his gut lending a powerful anesthetic.

The fighters were dwindling, and he knew his true opponents were among the remainder, but it was not yet time for them. He parried with a thin, quick little thing, faster than he but awkward with a club. The little thing was fast and landed a blow to his torso, but it was so weak and full of restraint Hahn didn’t bother blocking. Little things with restraint did not have much chance of toppling him.

The little thing realized this too late, and turned to flee, but the hunter landed a heavy blow against the little back, and he felt the little body crack and crumple to the floor.

Above them, the silent spectators watched like gods, divine overseers hovering beyond the spectacle of pain. They were shadowed beneath the glow of the chandelier, but occasionally glittered with gold, or gems, or bright, watchful eyes. No sound filtered from the upper world to the arena below, but the spectators had little electric lights, which they pointed through the glass at their favorite fighters, indicating and chatting and discussing the exciting possibility of the upcoming games.

They motioned to this fighter or that. They knelt down and shouted at a fallen warrior. They mimed the combat. They traded money back and forth as bets were won or lost.

And they laughed, having a joyous time.
