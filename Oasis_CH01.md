## Chapter 1: The Hunt


I am the Storyteller; listen.

A story can be many things, but foremost it is a journey.  The journey of someone who stretches out his or her hand towards something, and is willing to face all obstacles to reach for it. The most beloved tales have a hero at the helm, a gallant figure who represents everything that we are not, a model to fix our eyes upon and mold our lives after. If mankind is fashioned from the mud of the Earth and the breath of the Creator, then the hero must rank nearer to the Creator on this scale. He serves to inspires us to reach towards the sun.

Yet in spite of these noble models, the threads of humankind are more tightly woven with the soil of the Earth, the beasts of the forest, and the things hidden beneath. With these heroes so few and distant, we find ourselves instead surrounded by men closer to mud.

But nothing is more certain in life than the uncertainty of life; we too easily forget that we are not stagnant shapes, not men of stone, but constantly changing. And it is often the whim of gods to continue refining a man of mud, to see what could be made of him, because it is in the nature of a Creator to create for no other purpose than seeing what can be made.

 

These are my favorite stories, where we have the privilege of witnessing how a man may be molded into his best form, or perhaps into his worst form. How he may ascend or descend, or both, at times. And perhaps we’ll see a little of ourselves in him, as fellow men of mud.


I am the Storyteller. Let us turn our gaze to this world where men of mud toil endlessly in a desperate attempt to thrive and build, and create something lasting in the short gasp of their existence.

 

And look here; one hunter has caught the scent of his quarry. Shall we see what he's found?

Johannes Walker’s nose curled at the stench of soured milk carried on the autumn breeze. He couldn’t see his target yet, but it was most certainly here among the cedars, rooting somewhere downwind of him; one, perhaps two parasitic livercrawlers. Oleander subtype judging by the floral scent; *Apocarnididae Nerium*.

Finally.

He’d been hunting near half a day already, having sent the rest of the party ahead of him back towards the Sprawl so that he could pursue one final prey. He was at home here, in the solitude of the hunt, in bated breaths and strained ears and silent, cautious steps. His eyes and mind had the sharp edge of the predator and his body moved with an unearthly precision. Hahn was not a particularly superstitious man, yet in these moments it seemed as if he were designed for this purpose. This was where he belonged.

 

And there! He could see it now. Stumbling unnaturally through the tall grasses came a large boar with red flowers blooming over its backside like bursts of blood. Hahn slowly crouched among the brush, lifting the scope of an old but well-kept bolt-action rifle to follow the creature’s motion.
 

Vines emerged from a wound in the unfortunate creature’s abdomen, twisting through its insides and around its outsides, forcing it to ambulate in a jerking, uncoordinated gait. That coveted milksap — the reason for the entire expedition — dripped from the wound, creating an opalescent trail through the grasses and yielding its stench to the wind.

 

The nose of the rifle followed the creature foraging in a sick mimicry of animal life, waiting for the perfect shot. The parasite was buried deep inside the boar, and if he failed to land a clean hit he may not get a second chance.
 
The first shot rang through the trees, scattering the birds and other small life. The boar emitted a shrill, warbling scream that was not of this world as it stumbled through the grass. In a swift motion Hahn flicked up, back, and forward the bolt and fired a second round just to be certain of his victory. If he had to fire a third time, well, he figured he deserved to be eaten by the crawler.

The Suprex-tipped bullets sent the creature into panicked seizures, the immediate neurotoxicity of the chemical manifesting in the wild thrashing of the vines. It made a valiant effort to retract all of its parts back inside the carcass of the boar, and the price of that retreat was the meager ambulatory ability it had possessed. The boar fell over into the grasses, milksap oozing from the bullet holes. The parasite’s vines contracted briefly, then relaxed and fell around the corpse of the boar. Silence stretched outward from the scene.

 

There was a moment of stillness; nothing moved.

 

When certain of his victory, Hahn lowered the rifle. As he approached the boar, his eyes caught on the dead sockets of the animal, writhing with insects. The boar’s meat was useless now, half-rotted and infested with larvae, but the milkweed sap… that was the real motivation for braving the dangers of the livercrawlers. One vial of it carried enough bartering power to supply the Sprawl with several commodities through the winter; salt, coffee, butter, and most importantly of all, Suprex.

 

Johannes set his rifle aside and began processing the creature with practiced ease. He produced from his pack a kit designed for this kind of harvesting, and he opened it to reveal the gleaming instruments within; various sizes of scalpels and medical scissors, reinforced pouches and lined vials, with other helpful miscellany; alchemist gloves, labels, tweezers, and the like. The kit had cost more than he cared to admit, but it sure as hell made the job faster. He pruned the leaves and the flowers on the outside, then he hefted over the boar and slid the scalpel along the stomach, opening the skin and tissue to expose the organs within. The stomach was knotted up with roots and vines and dripping milksap, and Hahn grabbed these firmly and pulled them out. Along these roots were violet fungi, little mushroom symbiotes hitching a ride. Hahn cut them from the roots and slid them into a pouch.

 

Harvesting the milksap was tougher – the nerium’s central ganglia was buried in the boar’s liver, hence the moniker *livercrawler* – and Hahn took great care in excising the infected organ. He held the liver in one hand and used a scalpel to make a thin slice, then carefully squeezed the contents into several of the available vials. He could feel the bulbous parasite that had taken up residence inside the liver, and though he knew the nerium was dead, his pulse quickened.

 

The milksap that filled the vials was a clean, creamy white, with only trace fluids from the boar visible. Good; it wasn’t much use to him it its current form, but it would fetch a higher bounty if pure.

 

Hahn packed the contaminated equipment into a sealed pouch and pulled off the thick gloves. And then his favorite part, the final step of the ritual; he plucked the last remaining flower from the butchered boar, saved just for him, his little reward. He popped that delicate blossom into his mouth, grinding it slowly between his teeth, savoring the nectar, as comforting and warm as a waiting lover.

 

Then he glanced towards the horizon where the sun was low and, in a habitual motion, rubbed the back of his neck. His sandy hair hid a rippling patch of burned, scarred skin, and he rubbed it the way one might rub a riverstone for luck.
 

Hahn stood and slung his pack over his shoulder, reclaimed his rifle, and began the trek to Mennuin’s Outpost.

 

---


*Mennuin’s the place to be,*  
*For beer and Suprex and tea,*  
*And knives and ammo and fleas,*  
*Mennuin’s the place to be.*

Johannes arrived at Mennuin’s Outpost just as darkness was settling over the region, and the bright color of the outpost’s many neon signs and relatively short *pharos* provided a beacon for weary travelers. The Suprex lighthouse burned an oil that was easily identifiable as sweet and vaguely rotten, but most considered it as the smell of *safety*.  

As a pungent repellant for all livercrawlers, a functioning pharos was critical for surviving the night.

In addition to the lighthouse emitting its noxious fumes, Mennuin’s was surrounded by a wall of piecemeal sheet metal and barbed wire. This served as a repellant for a different kind of monster – the bipedal kind.

It was Shirilotta on guard today. Johannes recognized her silhouette easily against the neon backdrop and, as he approached, he could even make out the sly smile that spread across her features.

“Aha! I thought you’d be along soon, there, Hahn,” she shouted down at him, her long ears swiveling in his direction. “Spotted yer convoy headin’ off– looked like a full haul, can’t believe they didn’ stop to share a spot with us fine folk!”

Shira, as they called her, was an equiline therianthrope – not the tall, long-legged, graceful type of equine, but the short and stumpy kind, from a clan of burros. A donkey satyr; her upper body was human except the tall, swiveling ears and the wild mane of gray hair, but her lower body curved into the hind legs and cloven hooves of the burro. She was short even by the standards of her race, but what made her formidable was the glint in her eye, the sternness of her voice, and the neon glinting off of the barrel of her weapon.

“Gotta get back an’ prep the Sprawl ‘fore the caravans come through,” Johannes called back, but they both knew the lie in his words. They stared at each other for a moment, Shira staring down at him from atop the guard post, rifle lowered but ready in her hand, and Hahn staring up at her from the base of the wall, mirroring her stance with his rifle lowered, but in hand. There was respect between them, but respect was not the same as trust.

“Ahh, get on in here, you,” she said finally, and cranked the lever to lift the heavy gate. “Pa’s waitin’ for ya at the shop.”

Mennuin’s Outpost was almost as old as Octavia herself, a place for traders and monster-hunters to exchange wares and pick up basic supplies. It was a ramshackle, make-shift sort of encampment, situated away from the arid forest in a steppe of dry grasslands. It was dusty and crude and every surface was spray-painted with graffiti, but it was the only place to find certain goods. Mechanical parts, in particular, were very difficult to find, and Mennuin himself had a passion for it and went to great lengths to fund expeditions as far as the Sobretses desert to harvest broken parts of machinery. Occasionally they even managed to assemble some sort of functioning vehicle, more valuable than a chest of diamonds here among the outlanders. Motorized vehicles and aircraft were prohibited for non-governmental usage, but laws were rarely given much thought this far from any walled metropolis.

The outpost was as lively as ever, sporting a small cluster of shacks not dissimilar from the ones in the Sprawl. There was a large tavern that spewed bawdry music and shouts, a string of shops – leatherworking, blacksmithing, poultices, and the like – and even a quaint little chapel. The chapel was more of a clinic than a place of worship, but the outposters evidently had some respect for the sanctity of the church, as it was the only building not spray-painted with skulls and neon flames.

The occupants of Mennuin’s little village were mostly therianthropes, although there was no shortage of humans as well. Many of these were outlanders and nomadic beastkin from tribes occupying the steppes and mountains, and these outlanders came to Mennuin’s for many reasons – provisions, information, as a pit-stop on a longer journey, or to hire bounty hunters and mercenaries. But, predominantly, Mennuin’s Outpost was populated by the squat, short-tempered burros and similar satyr kin. 

Johannes liked the Burro Clan; they were roughshod rogues who didn’t bathe nearly as often as they should, but they were a real salt-of-the-earth group who’d cheat you out of everything you own and save your ass from a livercrawler in the same night. He could respect that more than the humans who would never deign to cheat, but would turn a blind eye to men being eaten alive outside city walls.

The largest building was *Mennuin’s General Store*, and outside the general store lined many individual stalls hawking various wares, from tobacco to woven jewelry to baked goods to *”tobacco”* to hand lanterns to grilled frog skewers. The stall owners and patrons were making the last bargains and closing up for the night, so Johannes exchanged a couple of boiled eggs for a frog skewer and headed into the general store.

Father Barrabas, a dark-skinned, aging priest, was sitting at a writing desk just inside the door, which was comically small for the man and probably designed for primary school children. He was copying some sort of book into a second, blank one, but he glanced up when Johannes entered.

“Hahn!” He called up in a thick accent. “What news from Octavia?”

“Ah, same ole shit. I’m startin’ to think they don’ like us very much,” Johannes grumbled in mock hurt. “So much for that famed Octavian sense of charity, eh, Father? Workin’ on a lil something might help us, though – could be our ticket to freedom.”

“Ahhh,” rumbled the priest with a chuckle. He was wrinkled from long days in the sun, but strong in body and mind, and his voice caught on the rocks in his chest. “Finally leaving that wall? Where ya gonna head? Outland’s not an easy place to make a livin’.”

Johannes shrugged nonchalantly. “Octavia ain’t gonna open up, no reason to stay. Maybe we’ll move out here and be neighbors. Jakim an’ I’re both handy with mechanics, ‘n you know the pups are a fan of y’all.”

Father Barrabas smiled sincerely, as if the thought was truly a welcome one. Mennuin’s Outpost was left alone by the Octavian government on the stipulation that it did not expand, though, so they both knew that this proposed scenario was unlikely.

Johannes left Barrabas and walked down the main aisle of the general store, casting his eyes all around the establishment and chewing on the grilled frog. The aisles were full of preserved foodstuffs, mostly canned and jarred, but there were many rows of practical items; nails and hand-tools, lanterns, rope, and the like. A wide array of trophies hung along the walls; everything from mechanical parts to taxidermied livercrawlers to provocative paintings of beautiful bodies. Most of it was familiar, but one never did know what they might find at the general store, so he scanned all the same. Johannes tucked the used skewer into a shelf of canned beans as he passed. 

“Mennuin, ya hairy ass!” Johannes greeted when he reached the long counter, laughing at his own joke that Mennuin was, quite literally, a hairy ass. “I gotcha something a lil’ extra special today.”

“Ho, boy, what you sayin’ now?”

Large, gray ears appeared from behind the counter where the burro was stooped over, organizing receipts. He was an old beastkin and about half the height of Johannes, but the strength of five humans rested in his muscled arms, riddled with bright tattoos very similar to the graffiti on his shop. His gray mane was shaved along the sides and fashioned in a tall mohawk, spray-painted with stripes in an almost glowing yellow. Some may be tempted to tease Mennuin for his loud aesthetic, but his thick biceps and rippling pectorals were usually enough to discourage it, if his influence alone wasn’t.

“Got somethin’, ya say?”

Johannes set his pack on the counter and pulled out a small, wrapped music box, broken but with all of the mechanical parts present. Mennuin’s eyes immediately lit up.

“Ah-hah-hah! Let me see!”

Johannes and Mennuin bantered over the music box for a while, and after Johannes felt the burro was properly warmed over, they bartered over the milksap and harvested components. Once those were appraised in a way which was a compromise to both and a satisfaction to neither, the pair haggled over the goods Johannes would take back to the Sprawl with him. They were at it late into the evening, long after the shop closed for the night. Once all the haggling was done, the prices decided, and the bags loaded up, they switched to the warmer discussions of exchanging news and tales over beer. Neither considered the other a friend, per se, but they each appreciated gossip and a good story, and each provided that for the other. 

Once they’d exhausted every bit of news, Mennuin allowed Johannes the use of his storage shack for the night. It was fitted with a cot just for such occasions, and Johannes was always pleased to take up the offer. He might swipe an extra couple cans of tomatoes from the stock, maybe a pack of nails, and maybe Mennuin knew this, but their business relationship was valuable and Johannes wouldn’t jeopardize that with short-sighted greed, and Mennuin knew that as well.

Johannes settled into the hard, itchy cot and tucked his arms behind his head. He stared up at the small, barred ventilation window towards the top of the shack, moonlight streaming inside. He was surrounded by canned food and junk, moth-eaten leather, and the musty smell of mildew. He was pretty sure there were mites in his cot, and the thin sheet was not enough to shield the chill of the night. But Johannes was not uncomfortable here, all the same.

He closed his eyes and thought of his family; his wife Anna, and their little son Jonas. The situation for the Sprawl was precarious for all of them, and they all felt something uncanny on the horizon, something dark and creeping that they couldn’t quite identify. Was the threat of winter? Was it some unconscious instinct of a harsh season, something promised in the wind, maybe? 
 
But in this moment, after the success of a bountiful hunt and bags full of supplies, with the waning relaxation of the flower still working its way through his system, and the smell of Suprex in the air, things didn’t seem too bad.

And that is where we'll leave our man of mud.
