
## Chapter 2: The Dilemma

Let us turn away from the bawdry display of Mennuin's Outpost, and cast our gaze westward towards the Sea. Found there is another settlement, and more men and women of the mud. 

It was referred to as the Octavian Sprawl, a lesion on the side of the grand city’s stalwart Outer Wall. The Sprawl was a cluster of trash and refugees, an unsightly mass that had washed up against the wall two years ago, and remained huddled there ever since, desperate to stay within the protective range of the Octavian lighthouse.

Charity came from the city every now and then, usually in the form of supplies and foodstuffs, but it was not the sort of aid the refugees were looking for. They wanted to settle *inside* the Outer Wall, in the wide Octavian countryside, but to this the Octavians said, “Soon, soon… the council needs to make the necessary preparations.”

But *soon* remained ever over the next horizon.

Perhaps the council believed the problem would resolve itself if they waited long enough, but the tenacity of the refugees and the reach of the lighthouse meant the Sprawlers were able to provide for themselves well enough.

They were a lively bunch, these Sprawlers, and thick-skinned enough to endure hardship with a song. Shacks and lean-tos constructed from discarded metal, boards, and tarps made up the homes here, and they became more solid by the day. Food wasn’t exactly plentiful, but starvation was now rare, and even sicknesses were getting easier to manage. Every month had more comforts than the previous, more independence, and more optimism.

They had little gardens now. They had wood stoves. They had battery-powered lanterns and kits for cleaning water. They had beds and shops and hand-made cellars for preserving whatever extra supplies they could manage. These small, simple blessings felt luxurious to the Sprawlers, and there was a certain vitality to them that could not be stamped out.

Despite the whispers of winter in the breeze, spirits were high; the Octavian harvest festivals were starting, and they represented such an abundance of food and money that it overflowed all the way down to the Sprawlers. Though unable to enter the gates themselves, the masses of travelers and caravans heading into Octavia marked a unique opportunity for them to sell whatever they could scavenge, to pilfer and barter, and generally collect as much coin as possible from anyone stopping by on their way into the city.

And so the Sprawl was a buzzing hive of preparation – cleaning, building, fixing, creating, and gathering literally anything that might be useful to *someone*.

Brimjrar, a coyote therianthrope with all the vigor of youth, was perhaps the liveliest of all of them, and he sprinted through the main artery of the Sprawl, dodging people and piles of debris with deft abandon, his arms full of red fabric. He hopped over a barrel that rolled into his path, pivoted sharply into a large tent of stitched canvas, and tossed the red cloth into a pile. He threw his arms up triumphantly, panting.

“A new record!” he shouted.

Four old ladies stopped their sorting and sewing long enough to clap and murmur approvingly.

“What a lovely texture!” One said, hobbling over to stroke the shimmering red cloth. “Not many stains, ah, what a find, what a find.”

“Thanks, *sitva Nani*,” Brimjrar returned, his black-tipped tail wagging a little at the praise. “I can’t believe what the city folk throw out!”

He ran a hand - slightly padded like those of his animal kin - through his shaggy black hair, his fur-tipped ears folding back. He was a lesser therianthrope, which simply meant his animalistic traits were minor, and he had the long, straight legs of a human. The pads on his hands, the fur of his ears, and eyes that glowed in the night were the most bestial traits about him, but when he flashed his wide smile there was no hint of the predator in it. He had a little tail, too, brown and black, which wagged nigh unceasingly regardless of the weather. 

Brimjrar stuck out his chin and in a deep, theatrical voice accented in the manner of Octavians, said, “Oy, butler. Ho, butler! See this sheet here? There’s a bit of a stain - yes, yes, I know I’ve just bought it. What’s that? A washing? Oh, no, that won’t be necessary, just throw it out.”

He pantomimed tossing the unwanted object over the wall, and all the ladies cackled with laughter.

“Toss out that radio, too, you know the one, with the mildly jiggling knob. Ah yes, and that *vahse* with the chip in the corner! Can’t have that tarnishing our sitting room, now can we?”

The wiry beastkin exaggerated the motion of picking up something heavy and hefting it over the wall, relishing the chuckles of his audience. He kept up the gag long after it was funny and, when he finally noticed no one was paying attention, he stopped the game to collect his pay for the day’s labor. Nani handed over a package wrapped in paper, and Brimjrar peeked inside to find a fresh loaf of bread and two seagull eggs. The old lady smiled kindly, tapping one of the eggs.

“Be a dear and make sure Hahn’s little boy gets one of those, will you? It’s not easy doing all that growing in a place like this.”

“Yes, ma’am!”

The young coyote folded the paper back over his wages, thanked the ladies again, and then bounded back off down the narrow roads of the Sprawl to find his brother.

*Home* was such a loose term here in the Sprawl, but in his fifteen years of life Brimjrar couldn’t recall ever feeling more at home anywhere. There was a little piece of the Sprawl just for their family unit – him and Jakim in one shack, Hahn and Anna and Jonas in another – and out front there was a fire pit and a clothesline, and in the back their own mini junkyard, a shed, and Anna’s garden. The shacks were painted with graffiti animals by Brimjrar himself – he felt like it added a nice touch – and the air often smelled of stew and salted meats. Hahn could be challenging to get along with, and Brimjrar was frequently saddled with the task of babysitting Jonas while the adults were busy, but this was a chore he never minded much.

Brimjrar jogged down the path to the shack he shared with his brother, and his keen nose picked up a waft of floral perfume. It was faded now, and so he ventured to poke his head through the hanging flap of tarp that constituted their door.

“Jakim!” he called. 

Though they were bound by blood, Brimjrar's brother looked quite different. He had not been blessed with lesser therianthrope traits, as Brimjrar had. Nor did he have the regal, ferocious stature of the greater therianthrope. Jakim was... something in between the two. Typically therian hybrids had one aspect dominate the other -- whether that was the human aspect dominating the therian, resulting in lesser traits, or the therian dominating the human, resulting in greater traits. They could choose, then, to live a more human existence, or to take up with the beast tribes of the Outlands. But Jakim was... different -- *flawed*. He was uncanny, even hideous, and his shape was disfigured. He bore the deep-jointed knees and elongated feet of the therianthrope, but one leg was slightly longer than the other, giving him an awkward stance. He arms were unusually long, too, and half of his face was covered in fine, tan fur. Even his eyes were mixed, the furred side bearing a rich, golden iris, and the skinned side a drab hazel. What exposed skin he had was riddled with traditional piercings, and his arms were banded with the tattoos of the desert tribes.  His long, black dreadlocks did little to humanize his offensive figure, and some speculated that he'd been cursed by a capricious god, or stitched together in infancy from leftover parts. 

"Just the pup I wanted to see," Jakim greeted, smiling with half of his face. "I have a gift for you."

"Whaaaaaat? What is it?"

“Hang on, I should make the bed first,” Jakim said, turning to the mess of sheets. With a single motion, he whisked the fabric away, leaving the crates underneath bare. “There, all done.”

“Jakim!” Brimjrar exclaimed in exasperation, practically dancing around his brother in a circle. “Where. Is. The. Gift?!”

Jakim couldn’t help but to smile at his brother’s excitement. Childhood for their station… well, there usually wasn’t much of one, but he’d always done his best to make sure Brimjrar wasn’t forced to grow up too fast. Moments like these, with his brother’s exuberance and enthusiasm, he felt like he’d done something right.

“Alright, alright, keep your fur on! Here you go,” Jakim said, pulling from his back pockets two glass bottles with elegant wax seals. “Some of the finest ink in the country. Just in time for the festival!”

Brimjrar’s eyes grew wide, and he snatched the bottles as if they might disappear into thin air. “No way!” he exclaimed. “And red?? Where did you get these??”

Jakim shrugged, but smiled mysteriously and said, “I know a few tricks.”

The younger beastkin was carrying on about how much better his tattoos would be now, and how many new designs he could do with a second color, and how fine the quality was, but Jakim wasn’t listening. His sharp hearing was picking up a different sound; a soft sniffling.

“Brims,” he said, and held up a hand for his brother to stop talking. “Come on, I think we should check on Anna.”

Hahn’s wife was late into an unexpected pregnancy, and it had been a hard one for her, and for them. The brothers didn’t intend to pry, but they could hear the couple fighting occasionally, and they could hear Anna crying, and there was no greater fear for a young mother than an uncertain future. When Hahn was away, she immersed herself in work; growing, mending, tending, and caring for all of them, but it became more and more difficult, what with baking a new little Sprawler and taking care of Jonas. Jakim did his best to step up and help; she was like a sister, and they were all in this together.

“Anna?” the older coyote called out gently when they reached her shack door. It wasn’t latched, and he didn’t hesitate to push it open.

In a rickety, three-legged chair propped on a crate, Anna sat, her arms cradling her stomach and tears trailing down her cheeks. She looked up at Jakim and brushed at her eyes with a long sleeve.

“S-sorry, she’s just… She’s just not moving much and I’m too *small*, Jakim, she’s not growing right, a-and I–”

“Shhh,” Jakim soothed, and he didn’t waste any time in going to her side. He knelt on the dirt floor in front of her and placed an ear against her round stomach.

Jakim heard the flutter of the baby’s tiny heartbeat, and he smiled gently. “She’s doing just fine. Strong little heartbeat there – she’s gonna be a fighter like her dad.”

He stood and gave Anna a reassuring kiss on the forehead.

“Thank you, Jakim,” she murmured, still wiping at her eyes. She was still worried, but his words were comforting. “For everything.”

“Anna, look at this!” Brimjrar enthused in a loud whisper, trying not to wake the sleeping boy on the bed in his excitement. “Inks from Octavia! And red! We’ll be able to bring back the Mark of the Scorpion story!”

This time it was Anna who smiled, and she carefully stood, patting her round belly. For how late she was in her pregnancy, she *was* small, though she did her best to eat well and, between all of them, they never allowed her to go hungry. The baby moved some, but never enough, never enough to assure her that everything was alright in there, but all they could do was listen for the heartbeat and keep going.

“I love that one,” Anna replied kindly, and fixed her rumbled dress and hair. “We’re not doing that one tonight, though, are we? We should probably get to work, there’s a lot to prepare!”

Twilight settled over a vibrant Sprawl, alive with the bustle of movement and music. A giant bonfire was alight on the side of the settlement that faced the highroad into Octavia, and the Sprawlers set up a little welcoming area to attract the attention of the travelers. A musically-inclined trio were outfitted with a carved flute, a makeshift banjo, and a gourd balafon, and they played a series of lively songs while dancers twirled around the bonfire. Hawkers shouted at the passing caravans, and Sprawlers remained on standby with whatever hospitality they could manage.

*'Stay! Rest awhile! Enjoy some casual fun and earthly cooking before entering a stiff and overpriced city!’*

And some travelers did stop; those from humble origins themselves, those not overly afraid of being beaten and robbed, and those with more curiosity than good sense detoured from the highroad to set up camp along the wall. Many caravans continued through that gate into the safety of the Octavian countryside, but the Sprawlers kept singing their siren song, undeterred.

*'You won’t find goods or services for such a price anywhere in Octavia, that’s for sure!’*

An independent rider broke away from a cluster of ornate carriages, his horse clomping a leisurely gait from the highroad to the welcoming bonfire. He glanced down at his fist, and opened it to reveal seven coins stamped with an unusual crest; an ominous, skull-headed crow.

*Seek out the children,* they had instructed him.

He shuddered and closed his hand back around the coins; seven weren’t nearly enough.

The rider approached in silence, surveying the edges of the Sprawl and the various people who were gathering, already making themselves at home and joining the revelry. It amazed him how full of life this place was… when he’d left Octavia years ago, there had been no Sprawl, yet just in that span an entire village had popped up as if it had always been here. It was surreal to see such a familiar landscape, previously empty, now a place of noise and commerce. Poverty, yes, there was clearly that, but it was also a testament to the remarkable constitution of the human spirit.

The shouts and laughter grew louder as the rider approached, and a middle-aged woman waved to him.

“Ho, traveler!” she called. “Fancy a stable for yer 'orse?”

The ’stable’ she indicated appeared to be a long post where a variety of horses and mules were tethered near a trough, but the animals seemed happy enough munching the weeds so the rider nodded.

“Yes, please. Thank you, ma’am.”

A sharp, barking cackle burst from the throat of the woman. “‘Ma’am’, my, aren’t you a gentlemen! HOBBES!” She screeched, motioning broadly to get the attention of a dancing young girl. “HOBBES, GET THE FINEST DRY GRASSES FOR THIS ONE, 'E’S A CHARMER!”

The stranger smiled and, nearer now to the warm radiance of the bonfire, dismounted his mare and passed the reins to the woman.

“Need a name, m’lor– oh! Beggin’ pardon, *Father*. Need a name for when you collect yer 'orse.”

Beneath the shuffle of his riding cloak he wore the black garb of a priest, and he had a scholarly air about him, pale and freckled, with a thick mane of ginger hair and kind eyes.

“Ydranna,” he answered, and put a copper in the Sprawler’s hand, offering a small smile. “For the grasses.”

“HOBBES!” the Sprawler called to the girl. “WE GOT FATHER YDRANNA WITH THE DAPPLED MARE!”

Hobbes, a thin lass of about twelve, produced a piece of chalk from a pocket and flounced over to a wooden shack. On the wall of the shack, she scrawled some lines and looping scribbles in a column full of lines and loops. Father Ydranna tilted his head curiously; it didn’t look like any lettering he’d ever seen before.

“Thank you fer your patronage!” The Sprawler squawked, leading his mare to the trough of water. “Just make yer way down Main Street, we got lots of goods and services and lively festivities! Stuff you won’t find anywhere else in the world!”

He stood there a moment, silent, watching her go. He glanced at Hobbes, now dancing again near the balafon. He watched the band play their lively beat with instruments hewn together from trash and scraps. He watched the travelers, taking up seats on logs and stumps around the bonfire, opening kegs of ale to share with their newfound companions. He watched them all, one hand tucked into his pocket, his hand closed tightly around the seven precious tokens. He closed his eyes briefly.

He understood why he’d been chosen, but there was such a feeling of deceit that he just couldn’t shake. The priest bowed his head.

*'Adonai chonen otti chochmah* 
*Grant me faith, in Your path and in mine own intuition,*  
*Grant me the clarity to see what must be done,*  
*The courage to accomplish the task laid at my feet,*  
*And the grace to forgive myself and others.’*  

Then he straightened and headed into the Sprawl.

---

’Main Street’ was just the widest path of dirt in a place full of criss-crossing paths of dirt, and it was illuminated by torches, battery-powered lanterns, and the perpetual glow of the many small campfires both inside the Sprawl and all along the Outer Wall. People of all races were congregating in small groups, engaged in trade and chatter and merry-making, and there were little shops and stalls, and piles of junk with signs that read ‘Take Anything, 1 Copper’, and doors with red curtains and signs that said ‘Beautiful Women Inside’ and ‘Stress Relief Here’. Some of them had no signs, just the red curtains.

Many Sprawlers were rather clever artisans, and made jewelry out of metal rivets and wove cloaks from patchwork fabric, which were all the rage in Octavian high society. Some carved walking sticks burned with symbols of the indigenous tribes that roamed the Outlands, and others made foodstuffs and tinctures that were rare or even illegal inside the city. The Sprawlers were a very diverse population, and featured both the dark-skinned humans from the Tzorim Basin and light-skinned humans from Sobretses, and everything in between. Beastkin, too, were common among the Sprawlers, primarily lesser therianthropes with a few minor animalistic features, yet there was no racial tension here – they were all united in their poverty.

Dirt tracks branched off from Main Street and led down little alleys, most dark and private, but a few were lit up and welcomed exploration. One in particular – *Knob Nook,* it was called – was a favorite of the visitors, and was marked by a post with doorknobs dangling from cables.

The little alley leading down into Knob Nook opened into a wide space, where a fire crackled low in a pit and many travelers were seated on logs, listening to a story.

“Nik and his band of rogues could see the wavering green trees in the distance,” Jakim recited to a rapt audience, keeping his voice low and mysterious, “but from the top of the plateau they could also see Fura’s Scar, a crevasse that slices the desert in two all the way from Rasalhague to the Tzorim Basin. Nik felt his heart drop – his clues had placed Sappath el-Sappah on *this* side of the Scar, not that. He hung his head and climbed down the plateau to inform his comrades of this new impasse.”

Next to Jakim, his little brother Brimjrar made the motion of hanging his head and pretending to climb down. Jonas, a small and quiet toddler with golden curls, mimicked Brimjrar, partially hidden in the shadows of the other two.

Anna bustled around the guests, fulfilling orders for purslane wine, stew, and oat bread. The stew was a bit thin and the wine was a bit thick, but the food had a homey taste that some of the travelers enjoyed, and many remarked that it reminded them of their mother or their grandmother; it made them sentimental and they tipped well, so Anna kept the pot full.

“But Nik’s comrades would not be deterred!” Jakim continued. “After all, if they turned back now, what would they have to show for their struggle? Nothing! They’d given up everything for this journey, surely they could find a way. Let them pack up camp and travel to the edge of the Scar to assess their options.”

Brimjrar made the motion of pulling down a tent. Jonas made the motion of rolling up a bed.

Anna dropped violet little mushrooms into the stew, and they were so delicate that they dissolved in the hot broth instantly, swirling with the herbs and cooked rabbit and wild onion. These little mushrooms, paired with the wine, were just enough to keep the guests relaxed, imaginative, and in a state of wistful reflection.

“Giant spiders!” Jakim shouted, and Brimjrar made his best skittering sounds. “Crawling all along the walls of the Scar, each large enough to suck a man blood-dry. Nik and his men could see them swarming deep in the chasm, waiting red-eyed in the darkness for any who dared cross, blocking their path to the oasis of Shappath el-Shappah. Out of options now, he closed his eyes and prayed.”

Brimjrar bowed his head. Jonas clasped his hands.

Anna passed out wooden bowls of stew and refilled cups of wine. She came to a priest sitting alone on a log, but he raised a hand in refusal and said, “Just bread, please.”

“‘Dearest Alil, most beautiful Alil, Mother of the Sands, lend me your magic once again,’” Jakim prayed. “‘Please help us conquer this trial.’ But Alil was a fickle goddess, and she didn’t want to reveal her fondness for a mortal, so Nik prayed and prayed and prayed with no answer. For three days and three nights, without eating or sleeping, Nik showered Alil with lavish praise and begged her divine grace. Finally, touched by his perseverance, she descended and said, ‘Courageous Nik, no other mortal compares with your bravery and tenacity. For your wild spirit, I will grant you this gift, the Mark of the Stallion, and with it you’ll be able to run faster and jump farther than any before you, and have the strength to carry men across the Scar.’ And as Alil placed a gentle kiss on Nik’s head, the mark of the Stallion appeared on his body.”

Brimjrar pulled up the leg of his trousers to expose a tattoo of a leaping horse. Jonas jumped over a crack in the dry ground.

Anna sat down next to the priest, who was smiling and quietly asking her questions about the Sprawl, herself, her friends, and her son. She was grateful for the opportunity to sit for a while and talk to the friendly stranger.

“Using the Mark of the Stallion, Nik was able to put each man on his back and leap the entire width of the Scar, and spiders spat clumps of web to snatch him, but he landed safely on the other side. He did this again and again until each man was safely across, and in the distance they could see Sappath el-Sappah, and now nothing barred their path to the empress' treasure – at least, as far as they could tell…”

“Come back tomorrow for the exciting conclusion!” Brimjrar announced. “But in the meantime, get a Mark of the Stallion for only 5 copper – it’s a real tribal tattoo done with ancient techniques – and represents the grace of Alil blessing you on your journey. Some swear there’s enough magic in the mark to make you run faster!”

Jakim paused and glanced towards Anna, who was still talking in low tones to the priest, but now she seemed distressed and saddened. Her eyes were wet and her hands made nervous motions against her stomach. Brows furrowing, he stepped in her direction, but a man blocked his path, chattering excitedly.

“What a rousing tale! Are there other Marks of Alil? I must admit, I’ve never had the courage– b-but I’ve always wanted to, you know – I have some Steppe warrior in my blood! A lil’, o-on my mother’s side, I mean.”

Jakim beamed at the man. “Ahh, I can see it in your jawline, yes, no mistaking such a rugged shape. Tonight the Mother of the Sands is calling you to your destiny. Come inside, all of you, find the Mark that speaks to you most. My brother studied under a wise shaman, there’s no one more adept in the old ways, and maybe you’d like a piercing…”

And the brothers led the interested guests into the home-turned-studio to show off their selection of goods and services.

---

Within an hour Knob Nook was quiet, the fire now just a smolder in the pit and the last few guests getting their Marks inked by the coyote brothers.

Anna was in her shack with Jonas, moving around quickly, packing a few precious items into a small bag, her hands shaking and her heart pounding. Though not due back for another day, she half expected Johannes to burst through the door at any moment, furious that she would do this, and every sound made her jump.

In her mind, there was no man alive stronger than her Hahn, but… with that strength also came some difficulties. He was headstrong, and temperamental at times, but…

No one else could’ve gotten them out of Sobretses alive, she truly believed that.

Her marriage to Hahn had been more for utility than love. She *did* have love for him, and for Jakim and Brimjrar, and for many of the other Sprawlers she’d spent these years of hardship with. But…

But…

She loved Jonas more.

She loved her unborn daughter more.

The whole universe was in those little hands, and there was simply no comparison.

Crying softly now, she looked at the tokens in her hand, stamped with the skull-headed crow. There were two of them, one for her and one for Jonas, and the priest said they would get them into Octavia. He seemed honest, and…

She was afraid of being here another winter. She was afraid of giving birth again, and she was afraid for the baby’s life. She had to believe that they could make it inside the wall, and she would do anything to make that happen, to get to a place where they could have a proper doctor, and food, and just a chance for a real life.

Jonas was clutching her legs and asking what was wrong, but Anna didn’t reply. She picked up a pencil in one hand and laid out a piece of paper. Her hand was poised to mark the page, but she hesitated.

The priest had explicitly instructed her not to speak to anyone, nor to leave any messages behind, or else the operation might be jeopardized. But didn’t Hahn deserve to know something?

She was torn; if they were caught inside the wall illegally, they could be prosecuted along with their mysterious benefactor. But Hahn had fought so hard for them, how could she just leave without saying anything? Would he assume they were kidnapped? Could she lie, maybe reassure him without compromising their protector? Could she tell him not to look for her?

“Oh, Hahn…” she murmured, and the pencil she clutched trembled no matter how hard she tried to hold her hand still. “I don’t know what to do…”
