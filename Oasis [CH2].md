## Chapter 2: The Dilemma

The hunter inhaled a deep drag from a cigarette, his cool eyes fixed on the tallest structure in the outpost; Mennuin’s Lighthouse. It had the same personality as the other buildings here, patched with scrap metal, radiating neon lights, and graffitied with threats.

*Stay Away*

*Beware of dog*

*Trespassers will DEFINITELY be shot*

Hahn exhaled the smoke and took up a leisurely stroll along the perimeter of the fence surrounding the pharos, but the fence contained an opaque mesh cover that prevented any clear view of the inside. If he glanced up, he could easily see the garish magenta obelisk illuminated against the dawning sky, but there was nothing useful to be gleaned from the top of the lighthouse. Still, he was almost impressed by the consistency of Mennuin’s gaudy tastes, and had to admit that it was truly a beacon visible for miles.

Hahn paused near a padlocked gate, working through his cigarette and pondering his options. Folk of the outpost were not the ‘early to rise’ sort, and so the ramshackle shops and residences were still dark and quiet. The occasional figure moving about this early paid no mind to him, going about their own business, and so Hahn turned his consideration back to the fence. It was tall, but not impassable for someone with his upper body strength, although the coils of barbed wire lining the top did seem unpleasant.

He stuck the cigarette in the corner of his mouth and grabbed the top of the fence, careful to avoid the barbs. Then he hefted up his heavy body just enough to peer over the barrier into the dirt yard surrounding the lighthouse.

A wooden shack annexed the lighthouse, cables ran all through the yard, and unmarked barrels stacked up against the structures, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Hahn quickly found the control panels, but a long piece of sheet metal was leaned up against the lighthouse to block it from view.

Then something familiar shambled in his periphery and his blood chilled. A large canine infected with nerium stumbled out of the shack, its eyes milky and its body strangled with vines and scarlet flowers.

“FUCK!” Hahn barked and let go, immediately collapsing against the fence. He scrambled up in a flash and furiously sought his rifle, only he didn’t have it on his person, having decided earlier if he had trouble with the Outposters they were less likely to consider him a threat without his weapon. He cursed again and redirected to his belt knife, but an ominous click froze his movements. He slowly lifted his hands into the air, turning.

Father Barrabas stood behind him, gripping an antique handgun in both hands. The big man had the barrel trained on Hahn, but wore a gentle smile.

“Father,” Johannes growled through gritted teeth. “With all due respect, are you out of your goddamn mind!? You have a fucking livercrawler– what is that, stage 2? – A fucking livercrawler – Barrabas, you got kids here–”

“That’s enough outta yer mouth, lad,” Barrabas replied, his deep voice low. “Mennuin’s business is Mennuin’s. I think you oughta be gettin’ back to yer own folk.”

“They ain’t fucking pets, goddamn it–!”

“And what were you snoopin’ around for, Hahn?” Barrabas cut in, and this time there was harshness in tone. “Hm? What business you got with our lighthouse?”

The Outpost was rising now, the energy shifting from the stillness of night into the wakefulness of morning. Hahn backed down, unable to make a stand here, unwilling to answer Barrabas’ questions, he sulked back. Barrabas nodded towards the Outpost’s main gate, and Hahn turned to stride back towards the general store, where his packs were located.

He reached into his pocket to replace the cigarette he’d dropped, but when he found only two left in his pack, he decided to just cope with the frayed nerves.

Several days’ travel from Mennuin’s Outpost rested a settlement of a different sort; the Octavian Sprawl, a lesion on the side of the grand city’s stalwart Outer Wall. The Sprawl was a cluster of trash and refugees, an unsightly mass that had washed up against the wall two years ago, and remained huddled there ever since, desperate to stay within the protective range of the Octavian lighthouse.

Charity came from the city every now and then, usually in the form of supplies and foodstuffs, but it was not the sort of aid the refugees were looking for. They wanted to settle inside the Outer Wall, in the wide Octavian countryside, but to this the Octavians said, “Soon, soon… the council needs to make the necessary preparations.”

But ‘soon’ remained ever over the next horizon.

Perhaps the council believed the problem would resolve itself if they waited long enough, but the tenacity of the refugees and the reach of the lighthouse meant the Sprawlers were able to provide for themselves well enough.

They were a lively bunch, these Sprawlers, and were thick-skinned enough to endure hardship with a song. Shacks and lean-tos constructed from discarded metal, boards, and tarps made up the homes here, and they became more solid by the day. Food wasn’t exactly plentiful, but starvation was now rare, and even sicknesses were getting easier to manage. Every month had more comforts than the previous, more independence, and more optimism.

They had little gardens now. They had wood stoves. They had battery-powered lanterns and kits for cleaning water. They had beds and shops and hand-made cellars for preserving whatever extra supplies they could manage. These small, simple blessings felt luxurious to the Sprawlers, and there was a certain vitality to them that could not be stamped out.

Despite the whispers of winter in the breeze, spirits were high; the Octavian harvest festivals were starting, and they represented such an abundance of food and money that it overflowed all the way down to the Sprawlers. Though unable to enter the gates themselves, the masses of travelers and caravans heading into Octavia marked a unique opportunity for them to sell whatever they could scavenge, to pilfer and barter, and generally collect as much coin as possible from anyone stopping by on their way into the city.

And so the Sprawl was a buzzing hive of preparation – cleaning, building, fixing, creating, and gathering literally anything that might be useful to someone.

Brimwylf, a coyote beastkin with all the energy of youth, was perhaps the liveliest of all of them, and he sprinted through the main artery of the Sprawl, dodging people and piles of debris with deft abandon, his arms full of red fabric. He hopped over a barrel that had rolled into his path, pivoted sharply into a large tent of stitched canvas, and tossed the red cloth into a pile. He threw his arms up triumphantly, panting.

“A new record!” he shouted.

Four old ladies stopped their sorting and sewing long enough to clap and murmur approvingly.

“What a lovely texture!” One said, hobbling over to stroke the shimmering red cloth. “Not many stains, ah, what a find, what a find.”

“Thanks, sitva Nani,” Brimwylf returned, his black-tipped tail wagging a little at the praise. “I can’t believe what the city folk throw out!”

He ran a hand, slightly padded like those of his animal kin, through his black hair, his fur-tipped ears folding back. He stuck out his chin and in a deep, theatrical voice accented in the way of the Octavians, said, “Oy, butler. Ho, butler! See this sheet here? There’s a bit of a stain - yes, yes, I know I’ve just bought it. What’s that? A washing? Oh, no, that won’t be necessary, just throw it out.”

He pantomimed tossing the unwanted object over the wall, and all the ladies cackled with laughter.

“Toss out that radio, too, you know the one, with the mildly jiggling knob. Ah yes, and that vahse with the chip in the corner! Can’t have that tarnishing our sitting room, now can we?”

The wiry beastkin exaggerated the motion of picking up something heavy and hefting it over the wall, relishing the chuckles of his audience. He kept up the gag long after it was funny and, when he finally noticed no one was paying any more attention, he stopped the game to collect his pay for the day’s labor. Nani handed over a package wrapped in paper, and Brimwylf peeked inside to find a fresh loaf of bread and two seagull eggs. The old lady smiled kindly, tapping one of the eggs.

“Be a dear and make sure Hahn’s little boy gets one of those, will you? It’s not easy doing all that growing in a place like this.”

“Yes, ma’am!”

The young coyote folded the paper back over his wages, thanked the ladies again, and then bounded back off down the narrow roads of the Sprawl to find his brother.

Home was such a loose term here in the Sprawl, but in his fifteen years of life Brimwylf couldn’t recall ever feeling more at home anywhere. There was a little piece of the Sprawl just for their family unit – him and Janus in one shack, Hahn and Anna and Jae in another – and out front there was a fire pit and a clothesline, and in the back their own mini junkyard, a shed, and Anna’s garden. The shacks were painted with graffiti animals by Brimwylf himself – he felt like it added a nice touch – and the air often smelled of stew and salted meats. Hahn could be challenging to get along with, and Brimwylf was frequently saddled with the task of babysitting Jae while the adults were busy, but this was a chore he never minded much.

Brimwylf jogged down the path to the shack he shared with his brother, and his keen nose picked up a waft of floral perfume. It was faded now, and so he ventured to poke his head through the hanging flap of tarp that constituted their door.

“Janus!” he called. “How’s Mrs. Mourney doin’?”

Brimwylf’s brother was a tall, lean coyote beastkin with olive-toned skin and long, dark dreadlocks, and he could almost pass as human if he had the mind to. He was riddled with piercings, both traditional and contemporary, and his exposed arms had bands of tattoos in the manner of the desert tribes. He was putting on a tattered belt that was so stretched thin, it was wildly unhelpful in keeping his pants up.

“Better these days, seems like. She brought ya something,” Janus replied.

“Whaaat? Where is it? You holdin’ out on me??”

“Hang on, I should make the bed first,” Janus said, turning to the mess of sheets. With a single motion, he whisked the fabric away, leaving the crates underneath bare. “There, all done.”

“Janus!” Brimwylf exclaimed in exasperation, practically dancing around his brother in a circle. “Where. Is. The. Gift?!”

Janus couldn’t help but to smile at his brother’s excitement. Childhood in the Sprawl… well, there usually wasn’t much of one, but he’d always done his best to make sure Brimwylf wasn’t forced to grow up too fast. Moments like these, with his brother’s exuberance and enthusiasm, he felt like he’d done something right.

“Alright, alright, keep your fur on! Here you go,” Janus said, pulling from his back pockets two glass bottles with elegant wax seals. “Some of the finest ink money – or charm – can buy. Just in time for the festival!”

Brimwylf’s eyes grew wide, and he snatched the bottles as if they might disappear into thin air. “No way!” he exclaimed. “And red?? This is awesome – man, Mrs. Mourney must really like you.”

Janus shrugged, but smiled mysteriously and said, “I know a few tricks.”

The younger beastkin was carrying on about how much better his tattoos would be now, and how many new designs he could do with a second color, and how fine the quality was, but Janus wasn’t listening. His sharp hearing was picking up a different sound, sniffling and crying.

“Brims,” he said, and held up a hand for his brother to stop talking. “Come on, I think we should check on Anna.”

Hahn’s wife was late into an unexpected pregnancy, and it had been a hard one for her, and for them. The brothers didn’t intend to pry, but they could hear the couple fighting occasionally, and they could hear Anna crying, and there was no greater fear for a young mother than an uncertain future. When Hahn was away, she immersed herself in work; growing, mending, tending, and caring for all of them, but it became more and more difficult, what with baking a new little Sprawler and taking care of Jae. Janus did his best to step up and help; she was like a sister, and they were all in this together.

“Anna?” the coyote called out gently when they reached her shack door. It wasn’t latched, and he didn’t hesitate to push it open.

In a rickety, three-legged chair propped on a crate, Anna sat, her arms cradling her stomach and tears trailing down her cheeks. She looked up at Janus and brushed at her eyes with a long sleeve.

“S-sorry, she’s just…. She’s just not moving much and I’m too small, Janus, she’s not growing right, a-and I–”

“Shhh,” Janus soothed, and he didn’t waste any time in going to her side. He knelt on the dirt floor in front of her and placed an ear against her round stomach.

Janus heard the flutter of the baby’s tiny heartbeat, and he smiled gently. “She’s doing just fine. Strong little heartbeat there – she’s gonna be a fighter like her dad.”

He stood and gave Anna a reassuring kiss on the forehead.

“Thank you, Janus,” she murmured, still wiping at her eyes. She was still worried, but his words were comforting. “For everything.”

“Anna, look at this!” Brimwylf enthused in a loud whisper, trying not to wake the sleeping boy on the bed in his excitement. “Inks from Octavia! And red! We’ll be able to bring back the Mark of the Scorpion story!”

This time it was Anna who smiled, and she carefully stood, patting her round belly. For how late she was in her pregnancy, she was small, though she did her best to eat well and, between all of them, she never went hungry. The baby moved some, but never enough, never enough to assure her that everything was alright in there, but all they could do was listen for the heartbeat and keep going.

“I love that one,” Anna replied kindly, and fixed her rumbled dress and hair. “We’re not doing that one tonight, though, are we? We should probably get to work, there’s a lot to prepare!”

Twilight settled over a vibrant Sprawl, alive with the bustle of movement and music. A giant bonfire was alight on the side of the settlement that faced the highroad into Octavia, and the Sprawlers set up a little welcoming area to attract the attention of the travelers. A musically-inclined trio were outfitted with a carved flute, a makeshift banjo, and a gourd balafon, and they played a series of lively songs while dancers twirled around the bonfire. Hawkers shouted at the passing caravans, and Sprawlers remained on standby with whatever hospitality they could manage.

’Stay! Rest awhile! Enjoy some casual fun and earthly cooking before entering a stiff and overpriced city!’

And some travelers did stop; those from humble origins themselves, those not overly afraid of being beaten and robbed, and those with more curiosity than good sense, detoured from the highroad to set up camp along the wall. Many caravans continued through that gate into the safety of the Octavian countryside, but the Sprawlers kept singing their siren song, undeterred.

’You won’t find goods or services for such a price anywhere in Octavia, that’s for sure!’

An independent rider broke away from a cluster of ornate carriages, his horse clomping a leisurely gait from the highroad to the welcoming bonfire. He glanced down at his fist, and opened it to reveal seven coins stamped with an unusual crest; an ominous, skull-headed crow.

’Seek out the children.’

He shuddered and closed his hand back around the coins; it wasn’t nearly enough.

The rider approached in silence, surveying the edges of the Sprawl and the various people who were gathering, already making themselves at home and joining the revelry. It amazed him how full of life this place was… when he’d left Octavia years ago, there had been no Sprawl, yet just in that span an entire village had popped up as if it had always been here. It was surreal to see such a familiar landscape, previously empty, now a place of noise and commerce. Poverty, yes, there was clearly that, but it was also a testament to the remarkable constitution of the human spirit.

The shouts and laughter grew louder as the rider approached, and a middle-aged woman waved to him.

“Ho, traveler!” she called. “Fancy a stable for yer horse?”

The ’stable’ she indicated appeared to be a long post where a variety of horses and mules were tethered near a trough, but the animals seemed happy enough munching the weeds so the rider nodded.

“Yes, please. Thank you, ma’am.”

A sharp, barking cackle burst from the throat of the woman. “‘Ma’am’, my, aren’t you a gentlemen! HOBBES!” She screeched, motioning broadly to get the attention of a dancing young girl. “HOBBES, GET THE FINEST DRY GRASSES FOR THIS ONE, HE’S A CHARMER!”

The stranger smiled and, nearer now to the warm radiance of the bonfire, dismounted his mare and passed the reins to the woman.

“Need a name, m’lor– oh! Beggin’ pardon, Father. Need a name for when you collect yer horse.”

Beneath the shuffle of his riding cloak he wore the black garb of a priest, and he had a scholarly air about him, pale and freckled, with a thick mane of ginger hair and kind eyes.

“Ydranna,” he answered, and put a copper in the Sprawler’s hand, offering a small smile. “For the grasses.”

“HOBBES!” the Sprawler called to the girl. “WE GOT FATHER YDRANNA WITH THE DAPPLED MARE!”

Hobbes, a thin lass of about twelve, produced a piece of chalk from a pocket and flounced over to a wooden shack. On the wall of the shack, she scrawled some lines and looping scribbles in a column full of lines and loops. Father Ydranna tilted his head curiously; it didn’t look like any lettering he’d ever seen before.

“Thank you fer your patronage!” The Sprawler squawked, leading his mare towards the trough of water. “Just make yer way down Main Street, we got lots of goods and services and lively festivities! Stuff you won’t find anywhere else in the world!”

He stood there a moment, silent, watching her go. He glanced at Hobbes, now dancing again near the balafon. He watched the band play their lively beat with instruments hewn together from trash and scraps. He watched the travelers, taking up seats on logs and stumps around the bonfire, opening kegs of ale to share with their newfound companions. He watched them all, one hand tucked into his pocket, his hand closed tightly around the seven precious tokens. He closed his eyes briefly.

He understood why he’d been chosen, but there was such a feeling of wrongness and deceit that he just couldn’t shake. The priest bowed his head.

‘God, grant me wisdom,
Grant me faith, in Your path and in mine own intuition,
Grant me the clarity to see what must be done,
The courage to accomplish the task laid at my feet,
And the grace to forgive myself and others.’

Then he straightened and headed into the Sprawl.

’Main Street’ was just the widest path of dirt in a place full of criss-crossing paths of dirt, and it was illuminated by torches, battery-powered lanterns, and the perpetual glow of the many small campfires both inside the Sprawl and all along the Outer Wall. People of all races were congregating in small groups, engaged in trade and chatter and merry-making, and there were little shops and stalls, and piles of junk with signs that read ‘Take Anything, 1 Copper’, and doors with red curtains and signs that said ‘Beautiful Women Inside’ and ‘Stress Relief Here’. Some of them had no signs, just the red curtains.

Many Sprawlers were rather clever artisans, and made jewelry out of metal rivets and wove cloaks from patchwork fabric, which were all the rage in Octavian high society. Some carved walking sticks burned with symbols of the indigenous tribes that roamed the Outlands, and others made foodstuffs and tinctures that were rare or even illegal inside the city. The Sprawlers were a very diverse population, and featured both the dark-skinned humans from the Tzorim Basin and light-skinned humans from Sobretses, and everything in between. Beastkin, too, were common among the Sprawlers, primarily lesser therianthropes with a few minor animalistic features, yet there was no racial tension here – they were all united in their poverty.

Dirt tracks branched off from Main Street and led down little alleys, most dark and private, but a few were lit up and welcomed exploration. One in particular – Knob Nook, it was called – was a favorite of the visitors, and was marked by a post with doorknobs dangling from cables.

The little alley leading down into Knob Nook opened into a wide space, where a fire crackled low in a pit and many travelers were seated on logs, listening to a story.

“Nik and his band of rogues could see the wavering green trees in the distance,” Janus recited to a rapt audience, keeping his voice low and mysterious, “but from the top of the plateau they could also see Fura’s Scar, a crevasse that slices the desert in two all the way from Rasalhague to the Tzorim Basin. Nik felt his heart drop – his clues had placed Sappath el-Sappah on this side of the Scar, not that. He hung his head and climbed down the plateau to inform his comrades of this new impasse.”

Next to Janus, his little brother Brimwylf made the motion of hanging his head and pretending to climb down. Jae, a small and quiet toddler with golden curls, mimicked Brimwylf, partially hidden in the shadows of the other two.

Anna bustled around the guests, fulfilling orders for purslane wine, stew, and oat bread. The stew was a bit thin and the wine was a bit thick, but the food had a homey taste that some of the travelers enjoyed, and many remarked that it reminded them of their mother or their grandmother; it made them sentimental and they tipped well, so Anna kept the pot full.

“But Nik’s comrades would not be deterred!” Janus continued. “After all, if they turned back now, what would they have to show for their struggle? Nothing! They’d given up everything for this journey, surely they could find a way. Let them pack up camp and travel to the edge of the Scar to assess their options.”

Brimwylf made the motion of pulling down a tent. Jae made the motion of rolling up a bed.

Anna dropped violet little mushrooms into the stew, and they were so delicate that they dissolved in the hot broth instantly, swirling with the herbs and cooked rabbit and wild onion. These little mushrooms, paired with the wine, were just enough to keep the guests relaxed, imaginative, and in a state of wistful reflection.

“Giant spiders!” Janus shouted, and Brimwylf made his best skittering sounds. “Crawling all along the walls of the Scar, each large enough to suck a man blood-dry. Nik and his men could see them swarming deep in the chasm, waiting red-eyed in the darkness for any who dared cross, blocking their path to the oasis of Shappath el-Shappah. Out of options now, he closed his eyes and prayed.”

Brimwylf bowed his head. Jae clasped his hands.

Anna passed out wooden bowls of stew and refilled cups of wine. She came to a priest sitting alone on a log, but he raised a hand in refusal and said, “Just bread, please.”

“‘Dearest Alil, most beautiful Alil, Mother of the Sands, lend me your magic once again,’” Janus prayed. “‘Please help us conquer this trial.’ But Alil was a fickle goddess, and she didn’t want to reveal her fondness for a mortal, so Nik prayed and prayed and prayed with no answer. For three days and three nights, without eating or sleeping, Nik showered Alil with lavish praise and begged her divine grace. Finally, touched by his perseverance, she descended and said, ‘Courageous Nik, no other mortal compares with your bravery and tenacity. For your wild spirit, I will grant you this gift, the Mark of the Stallion, and with it you’ll be able to run faster and jump farther than any before you, and have the strength to carry men across the Scar.’ And as Alil placed a gentle kiss on Nik’s head, the mark of the Stallion appeared on his body.”

Brimwylf pulled up the leg of his trousers to expose a tattoo of a leaping horse. Jae jumped over a crack in the dry ground.

Anna sat down next to the priest, who was smiling and quietly asking her questions about the Sprawl, herself, her friends, and her son. She was grateful for the opportunity to sit for a while and talk to the friendly stranger.

“Using the Mark of the Stallion, Nik was able to put each man on his back and leap the entire width of the Scar, and spiders spat clumps of web to snatch him, but he landed safely on the other side. He did this again and again until each man was safely across, and in the distance they could see Sappath el-Sappah, and now nothing barred their path to the emperor’s treasure – at least, as far as they could tell…”

“Come back tomorrow for the exciting conclusion!” Brimwylf announced. “But in the meantime, get a Mark of the Stallion for only 5 copper – it’s a real tribal tattoo done with ancient techniques – and represents the grace of Alil blessing you on your journey. Some swear there’s enough magic in the mark to make you run faster!”

Janus paused and glanced towards Anna, who was still talking in low tones to the priest, but now she seemed distressed and saddened. Her eyes were wet and her hands made nervous motions against her stomach. Brows furrowing, he stepped in her direction, but a man blocked his path, chattering excitedly.

“What a rousing tale! Are there other Marks of Alil? I must admit, I’ve never had the courage– b-but I’ve always wanted to, you know – I have some Steppe warrior in my blood! A lil’, o-on my mother’s side, I mean.”

Janus beamed at the man. “Ahh, I can see it in your jawline, yes, no mistaking such a rugged shape. Tonight the Mother of the Sands is calling you to your destiny. Come inside, all of you, find the Mark that speaks to you most. My brother studied under a wise shaman, there’s no one more adept in the old ways, and maybe you’d like a piercing….”

And the brothers led the interested guests into the home-turned-studio to show off their selection of goods and services.

Within an hour Knob Nook was quiet, the fire now just a smolder in the pit and the last few guests getting their Marks inked by the coyote brothers.

Anna was in her shack with Jae, moving around quickly, packing a few precious items into a small bag, her hands shaking and her heart pounding. Though not due back for several days, she half expected Johannes to burst through the door at any moment, furious that she would do this, and every sound made her jump.

In her mind, there was no man alive stronger than her Hahn, but… with that strength also came some difficulties. He was headstrong, and temperamental at times, but…

No one else could’ve gotten them out of Sobretses alive, she truly believed that.

Her marriage to Hahn had been more for utility than love, but she did have love for him, and for Janus and Brimwylf, and for many of the other Sprawlers she’d spent these years of hardship with. But…

But…

She loved Jae more.

She loved her unborn daughter more.

The whole universe was in those little hands, and there was simply no comparison for a mother.

Crying softly now, she looked at the tokens in her hand, stamped with the skull-headed crow. There were two of them, one for her and one for Jae, and the priest said they would get them into Octavia. He seemed honest, and….

She was afraid of being here another winter. She was afraid of giving birth again, and she was afraid for the baby’s life. She had to believe that they could make it inside the wall, and she would do anything to make that happen, to get to a place where they could have a proper doctor, and food, and just a chance for a real life.

Jae was clutching her legs and asking what was wrong, but Anna didn’t reply. She picked up a pencil in one hand and laid out a piece of paper. Her hand was poised to mark the page, but she hesitated.

The priest had explicitly instructed her not to speak to anyone, nor to leave any messages behind, or else the operation might be jeopardized. But didn’t Hahn deserve to know something?

She was torn; if they were caught inside the wall illegally, they could be prosecuted along with their mysterious benefactor. But Hahn had fought so hard for them, how could she just leave without saying anything? Would he assume they were kidnapped? Could she lie, maybe reassure him without compromising their protector? Could she tell him not to look for her?

“Oh, Hahn…” she murmured, and the pencil she clutched trembled no matter how hard she tried to hold her hand still. “I don’t know what to do…”
