## Chapter 4: Bullet Point #1

The Outer Wall of Octavia was one of the most impressive structures on the continent, stretching it's nigh impenetrable barrier in a wide arc around the Octavian countryside, terminating at treacherous cliffs overlooking the Fanged Sea. Far more formidable than its kin at Sobretses, the Octavian Wall had to compensate for a weaker lighthouse, and it more than accomplished that; Octavia was widely considered unconquerable by man, the epitome of defensive engineering. 

On the other side of the wall were the agricultural lands, and eventually the city herself, seated on a throne of cliffs with the sea at her back. 

Hahn had never been inside the Outer Wall, but he’d read about it once during his adolescent tutelage. He regarded it now as if he’d never seen it, as if he hadn’t been living next to it for the past two years, as if it was an enemy he needed to vanquish. Getting one or two fit young people over that Wall wouldn’t be impossible, he surmised, and he’d always entertained various scenarios for breaching it. But those scenarios fell apart with a family in tow, and so he’d never had any reason to actualize the challenge.

The event was upon him now and he mentally ran those simulations again, finding their difficulty tantalizing. Unfortunately, he simply didn’t have the time for illegal entry; without proper paperwork, he’d be forced to skulk around the city, to lay low and move at night, to be discreet… and discretion had never been one of Hahn’s virtues. So he discarded those death-defying fantasies of scaling the Wall and focused again on their current course, which also involved a task that was not one of his virtues.

Supplication.

“Hey, Jakim,” he directed to his traveling companion, “you sure we didn’t pass the damn thing?”

The lesser therianthrope cast a glance towards the Wall, his coyote ears pricking forward to pick up any sounds. His olive skin was beaded with sweat and his dreadlocks were tied back, but neither offered much reprieve from the autumn sun mercilessly beating down.

“We didn’t pass it.”

“Gonna walk straight into the sea at this rate,” Hahn grumbled.

They’d been following the perimeter of the Wall for the better part of the day, and now the sun was high and hot above them, apparently having forgotten all about winter on the horizon. The landscape on this side of the Wall was eerily barren, scorched clean for a mile out by flamethrower-wielding special forces tasked with burning every hint of vegetation. There was no shade, no greenery, no life at all – even the insects had largely fled the area. The Wall, too, seemed oddly abandoned, without any suggestion of a wall guard or sentry. The silence was deafening, and they both felt the hairs prickle at their necks and forearms. Breaking it with chatter was even more unnerving, as if the land itself wanted to suppress any sound.

There wasn’t much to discuss, anyway; they were rushing headlong without a real plan, and they knew it. Neither knew what awaited on the other side of that Wall, and so whatever plan they conceived felt naive and inadequate. Hahn would have to survive a week of harrowing combat before he even had freedom of movement, and Jakim would have the burden of his little brother in addition to any restrictions placed on him by the militia. And so, they simply didn’t discuss it.

They didn’t discuss the possibility of death. They didn’t discuss what the Sprawlers would do without them. They didn’t discuss whatever the hell a *wasting dragon* was. And they most certainly didn’t discuss the copper token stamped with the skulled crow.

Get into the city. 

Find the ginger-haired priest. 

Collect Hahn’s family – or his son, at a minimum.

Gain the service of an engineer, willingly or unwillingly.

And then, God willing, finally get the Sprawl caravan moving again. They could head towards the steppe, perhaps negotiate with the tribal therianthropes who roamed there and set up a small village. It was certainly dangerous but, given their historical migrations, that aspect held little weight in the decision.

That was what they had; a bullet list of nebulous, ambitious objectives, and any one of them could create an insurmountable impasse. 

Finally, after so many hours of trekking through the rocks beneath the blazing sun, covered with sweat and blowing dust, Jakim stopped, his ears pricking forward.

“...I think this is it.”

“Praise the Lord,” Hahn mumbled, bastardizing the sign of the cross over his chest. He pulled a large, compound hunting bow from his back and set about preparing the weapon, while Jakim paced back and forth along the wall, seeking the perfect location. Finally the coyote stopped and marked an ‘X’ with his boot in the dry ground.

“Try here.”

The hunter took his place on the marked spot. He lifted the compound bow and pulled the bowstring, the pulley cams rolling back at the motion, and he held it there, aiming high enough to clear the Outer Wall. Taped tightly around the body of the arrow was a message scrawled in red ink.

“If a HARE can’t dodge an arrow, we’re doing the lieutenant a favor.”

Hahn loosed the arrow and it zinged over the wall, disappearing somewhere on the other side. They listened for a moment. Finally, Jakim nodded. “Nice shot.”

And the pair walked several meters along the perimeter and fired another one, an identical message taped against the body. They performed this ritual five times before Jakim smirked, his ears pivoting. “Listen to that; finally got someone’s attention.”

Hahn couldn’t hear a thing.

“Only HAREs hang out this close to the Wall,” Jakim continued. “They’ll get the message delivered.”

“Want me to shoot ‘em again?”

Jakim listened for a moment, then shook his head. “Nah, you got it. The lieutenant’ll ream you a new asshole if you murder one of ‘em. Let’s git before they come with cuffs.”

“Well, that’d at least get us on the other side of the damn Wall.”

---

“What is the meaning of this?”

Lieutenant Sentariel Blackstep was pulled up to her impressive seven-foot height, her posture impossibly erect, her shoulders set back and her arms folded behind her back in military fashion. She was a greater therianthrope – a full-faced lupus, her muzzle pulled into the sharp taper of a wolf’s maw, her brown and black fur trimmed neat and close, tamed into perfect obedience. She wore the black-and-gold uniform of the HAREs, fitted with gold stars to indicate her rank.

“Listen, Rielle–”

“You will address me properly, *Johannes Walker*.”

Though she was not broad, there was no feminine grace to the lieutenant, as if the straightness of her demeanor had affected her body, turning every curve into a line. Her ears and tail – typically the hallmarks of expression in beastfolk – were deliberately neutral, and maintained in such a way that neither a twitch nor swivel betrayed her thoughts. A small retinue of HAREs fanned out behind her, mostly human but the occasional therianthrope walked among them. They stared menacingly at the trio of Sprawlers on the other side of the room, exchanging meaningful glances and smirks.

“*Lieutenant Blackstep,*” Hahn obliged with a just *barely* sarcastic dip of his head, aware that this was not the time to push his luck yet unable to fully cloak his nature. Still, he phrased his next words very carefully. “You… graciously… informed us that we might make a request of you in the future, for… services rendered to the HAREs last winter.”

Hahn glanced at the subordinate HAREs but no trace of sympathy returned his gaze, just a haughty sort of mirth. 

*So that’s how it’s gonna be.*

“Lieutenant,” Hahn pressed more firmly. “We almost *died*.”

“Yet here you are, decidedly not dead.” The lieutenant peered at the Sprawlers emotionlessly, her dark eyes moving from Hahn, to Jakim, to Brimjrar, whose ears flattened and tail wagged hopefully. She was known for her strong sense of justice, and fairness, and she acknowledged that the request was more than equitable, and yet…

“*Why?*” Lieutenant Blackstep asked slowly. She carried the thick, throaty accent of Tzorim, and it rolled heavily over them like molasses. “The militia? The ludus? Why now? You will not have enough time to get into form before the Games.”

Hahn shrugged indifferently. “You said back then you couldn’t get us papers. Then let us earn our own papers.”

No one moved as she continued to study them. The evening was lively outside, with crickets happily chirruping beneath the windows and caravans rumbling down the highroad to the shouts of guards and Sprawlers, but in this room, everything was still.

“You’d abandon your Sprawl? Your family?” The lieutenant interrogated. “You claimed previously that you would not leave them.”

Jakim and Hahn remained silent, unwilling to reveal more than required. Brimjrar, however, visibly winced at the accusation, and the lieutenant beckoned him forward.

“Come, young man, and speak truth. Why do you wish to leave the Sprawl?”

Brims wilted beneath her hard gaze, fidgeting and running his hands through his shaggy, dark hair. He shifted his weight back and forth and glanced helplessly over his shoulder at his brother, but Jakim only offered a slight nod of encouragement. 

“W-well…” he started, looking down at his hands. “Sitva Nani says… there’s this monster coming for the Sprawlers… they call it the wasting dragon…”

The lieutenant’s head tilted slightly, her brow furrowing in consideration – the first traces of emotion since their meeting began. Finally, she said, “I know of no such thing. Smells of superstition. You would abandon kin for faetales?” 

“Ummm, sir– ma’am –  the truth is… uhh, we have no more kin.”

The lieutenant pulled her head back at this, glancing at Hahn inquiringly, but a sharp rapping at the door jolted through the heavy interview. A voice shouted from the other side of the door, “Lieutenant Blackstep! Livercrawler sighting three-mile up the Highroad!”

The lupin drew in a deep breath and slowly withdrew, gesturing to her men.  “You two, with me up the Highroad. The rest of you, escort these gentlemen to their destinations. Do not let them wander, do not let them speak to anyone, and do not let them out of your sight.”

She turned to Hahn, pulling back into her full stature and peering down at him from the end of her nose. 

“Octavia’s debt is justly repaid. If I hear of some scheme afoot, any foul plotting or felonious behavior, I will personally come for you.”

The she-wolf lingered to emphasize the threat hanging in the air. Then, when she could no longer justify inaction, she turned and left, pursuing the reports of the livercrawler. HAREs promptly surrounded them, cuffing their hands and grumbling about bad smells and fleas.

As he was being detained, Hahn nudged Brimjrar and winked at him in a rare display of approval.
