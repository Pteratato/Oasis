## Chapter 6: Ludus Kessouath

Wrapped in a womb of blackness, he quieted his breathing, waiting, straining his senses for any feedback. Hahn thought, for a moment, that he was back in one of those little cells around the arena, that perhaps the combatants would fight again, but when he lifted his hands there was only space. The space was heavy against him, the air oppressive, constricting his heart and lungs. It was hot and tasted of salt.



He strained for sound, any sound -- people, animals, even insects... or the trickle of water, a breeze... but nothing reached him. Something about the suffocating silence felt so *other* that it must comprise some intrinsic attribute of this infernal place. A curse, a ward, some threatening characteristic that warned against his being there. He didn't belong there. He shouldn't be there. A great impulse to flee rose up from within his chest. 



He moved blindly through the black sea of space, his feet shuffling over a surface of uneven stones. Groping hands found only more oppressive nothingness regardless of direction, and his heart hammered wildly in his chest. Hunter no longer, some primitive instinct informed him that he was the quarry now. Finding this situation unbearable, he gave a brash shout, preferring to face whatever stalked the darkness over this insufferable uncertainty.



It was the smallest sound that echoed back to him, so unexpected and frightening that it cut through the heat and chilled his bones. 



"Papa?"



Hahn pivoted sharply. “Jonas?” 



Penetrating the velvet space like a distant star was a small, violet light. It pulsed an erratic beat, and Hahn couldn't tell if it was small and near, or large and far, but he knew he must get to it.



“Jonas, can you hear me? Keep callin’ so I can find you!” Hahn called, picking his way as quickly as he dared traverse the rocks. He felt the tapered ends of stalagmites and was not surprised by this. He focused single-mindedly on the voice. As he moved, the memories came flooding back.



"Papa?"



“‘I might be a shit dad…’” he told Jakim. “…but I’m not gonna let my kid fall into their hands’.”



“Look, Hahn!” Anna peered up at him tearfully. “A perfect baby boy; he even has your eyes.”



“I wanted to get rid of you,” he whispered to the bundle in his arms. “Yer mom always was a stubborn one, so I guess we’re stuck. Sorry for your luck, kid.”



Hahn's throat constricted, but his steps were resolute. More daring now, more assured, he navigated the clusters of rock, following the pulsing signal. It drew him in, pulling him towards it, inviting him to come, and as he closed the distance his breathing became labored, his body simultaneously hot and chilled to its depths. Had his guiding light been some monster's eye, he would've preferred that over what he found at his destination.



The violet pulse emanated from the shaft of tunnel, the opening surrounded by sharp rock and thoralite in a great, gaping maw of a beast. It was impossible to tell how far it descended into the abyss, and the unnatural violet glow flickered deep from within.



Hahn recoiled in horror, his blood like ice.



“Papa? I’m here, papa!” Came the weak voice, far off, from deep down within the beast.



Hahn peered down the shaft where his son’s voice echoed up towards him, where the violet light flickered.



And he hesitated.



--



"--Sir! Excuse me, sir! I said 'excuse me'!"



Hahn jolted as a dark shape grabbed him, hot against his chilled skin, and he lashed back in defense. His fists seized leather and metal. He swung that body around and they were both on the floor and he was vaguely aware of shouts behind him, of his own hoarse voice demanding the location of his son, of a great clamor of metal and footfalls, and of--



--Sploosh! Frigid water splashed against his face, shocking his system like an electric charge. 



"Please, Sir! We're trying to help!"
 

Hahn became dimly aware that he was wrestling the studded leather armor of a guard. The lady behind him bore the red cross of a medic, empty bucket in hand, and others were gathered around now, guards and medical staff and dirty, bloodied, bandaged fighters. Hahn let go of the guard, and large fighter grabbed his arm and pulled him up.



"Battle's over, Friend," the fighter said, guiding Hahn to sit on a cot. "You're in the medical ward of the ludus now. This fine lady here was tending your wounds, see?" He pointed to Hahn's upper arm, where the bite he had received from the jackal was tightly bandaged. Now that it was indicated to him, he could feel the stiff pull of the stitches beneath the wrap.



"You're looking mighty unwell, Friend," the big fighter continued, "but we'll be able to rest soon. Would you kindly answer a few questions for the nice lady?"



"Thanks, Solianus," the medic smiled at the fighter as he turned to check on the young guard.



The figures swam before Hahn's vision, dark and rippling in vague, indistinct forms, and he couldn't quite make out their faces. Only their garb -- or lack thereof -- and warbling voices distinguished them from one another. The lady was a ripple of cream, the red cross on her breast swimming in a sea of milk, and she stood as close as she dared. Hahn sat unresistingly, his eyes squinting and his brow drawn in a dour expression.



She asked his full name in a supplicating voice and, thankfully, that was an easy one, because he could vaguely sense the fighter hovering nearby in the event of further trouble. He felt a vague desire to lie, or perhaps it was more of a repugnance to the idea of revealing anything about his true identity to these people with their warped, rippling faces, but the thoughts kept slipping through his mental grasp. Besides, was there anything even valuable about his name? Was it even real; written down anywhere, ratified, legal? It was his, though.



"....Johannes Walker," he answered finally, and he found his voice rough and foreign in his throat.


“Very good, how old are you, Mr. Walker?”



"Uhhh.... thirty? I dunno, how old do I look? You're the doc, you figure it out," he grumbled.



"I'm not that kind of doctor, sir," she said, jotting some notes down as she spoke. "It doesn't matter. From what principality do you hail?"



"....Sobretses."



"Very good. Any therianthrope blood?" 



"No."



"Godspells?"



He scoffed, wondering what divinity would want someone like him anyways.



"Just answer the lady's question," interjected the swimming, mostly naked pectorals of whatever fighter had pulled him up. Solianus, was it? "Do you have any godspells, blessings, curses, or any other divine attribution?"



"Just this handsome face," Hahn mumbled, deciding he wasn't a fan of this Solianus fellow. 



 “Any conditions? Diseases? Infirmities?”



Hahn paused, wondering if he should tell him that they didn't have faces. He knew what his problem was. Or did he? He thought he should know, but when he tried to recall his head pounded in his skull, halting each train of thought before its caboose crossed the track. 

"You're the doc," he grumbled again, visibly wincing and grabbing his head, "you--"

"--figure it out, yeah, we hear you, friend," finished Solianus on his behalf.



"M'not yer friend," Hahn mumbled under his breath, closing his eyes. Couldn't they just leave him be until it was time to fight again? He'd signed up for bloodsports, not a damn interrogation.



"Some kind of withdrawal, is it?" he heard the medic inquire, more towards the fighter Solianus than himself. "What is it? Nerium flower? Terraroot? Stexa? Mushrooms? His blood has an odd quality, did you see it?”

Hahn leaned back against the wall behind the cot, the rough stone cool against his back, and tilted his head down. The sounds of their voice faded into the distance. He thought, perhaps, if he could rest awhile, their faces might return, his thoughts might return, and he could remember what he was supposed to do in this situation. He wondered vaguely if it would be harder, or easier, to fight opponents with no faces. Faces give away a lot of useful information, but also... but also...



Someone was shaking him now. 



"What?" Hahn snapped, cracking his eyes to see the rippling, indistinct mask of the fighter way too close to his own. 



"Stay with us, friend," he said, still holding Hahn's arm. "You don't wanna give the fight up now, do you?"

"What do you know about it," Hahn mumbled dourly. While he was distracted by the fighter leaning over him, the sharp prick of a needle pierced his shoulder. He jerked slightly but the fighter held him.



"It's all right," Solianus soothed. "You're a prime asset of the ludus now; we'll fix you right up. Gotta have our fighters in the best shape to put on a good show, you know? Unfortunately you can't rest much yet, but there are some others to tend so we'll just give that a moment to work, see if it helps you out."

The injection spread from the site like a salve over an infected wound and Hahn felt near immediate relief. He remained slumped there, his eyes closed, as the cobwebs slowly pulled away from his brain. His gut relaxed and his heart soothed its hammering, and the clammy feeling of insects under his skin retreated. Meanwhile the medical ward gradually cleared out, and when he opened his eyes again there were only a handful of them left, mingled with the cream of medical personnel and the leather of a few guards, as well as--



"Ho, friend," the one named Solianus gave him a weary smile. Hahn rose from the cot to greet the man standing, and found his legs were steady under him now. "Good to see you lookin' better. Johannes, is it?"



"Aye." 



"Well met. Are you ready? The fighters are assembling in the arena, and if we don't show ourselves in... ten minutes or so, we'll like as not be disqualified. That would put a damper on the season, wouldn't it?"

Solianus chuckled and gathered up the remaining fighters in the medical ward while Hahn watched, his cleared mind working to sort through the information and experiences he'd had while incapacitated. The scenes came back to him in a halting, jerking, distorted fashion. He regarded Solianus' back, recognizing him as one of the fighters in the preliminaries, although they had not crossed weapons. Solianus had a handsome face and a muscular body, his chestnut hair cut short and neat, and he bore bright eyes and a smile. The others, too, reacted to him with familiarity and warmth, and Hahn realized that this was not Solianus' first rodeo with the Octavian ludus.

Like some big, brutish mother hen, Solianus fretted over the injured fighters, bandaging them and pouring water and helping them flex injured muscles. Why? He was clearly a fighter himself, girded as he was around the waist in the same meager cloth covering.

Solianus was dangerous, Hahn decided.



--



High over Octavia with her unceasing gaze, the *pharos* turned in perpetual vigilance, it's bright light both an invitation and a warning. Rising from the red cliffs over the harbor, it was one of the few pharoi that also functioned as a traditional lighthouse, hailing sailors far out into the Fanged Sea. The vaguely noxious scent of the Surprex oil wafted thickly from this origin to blanket the city, stretch its protective fumes over the miles and miles of Octavian countryside, and even reach as far as the Sprawl on the other side of the Outer Wall.

Though not as immense as the lighthouse at Sobretses, the Octavian pharos was a particularly lovely specimen of its kind, with gold filigree inlaid along the pale metal, and blossoms of quartz and semi-precious stones.  The people called her Seraphiel the Watcher, and frequently left little gifts and flowers and food along the base as tokens of gratitude for her eternal vigil.

There were few places in Octavia that Seraphiel's light couldn't penetrate. Far, far out from the city proper, past those miles and miles of countryside, inside the Outer Wall at the southern terminus was the Amphitheater of Wheels, one of the only sizable structures outside of the city. And beneath the Amphitheater existed a network of caves and tunnels, designed as a living space for hominids long before the founding of the city, the construction of the great walls, or the invention of the lighthouses. Affectionately referred to as the Warren, this network of caves and tunnels had been repurposed for many uses, but chiefly among them was the home of *Ludus Kessouath*, which would seasonally fill up with the best -- or at least the boldest -- fighters from all over the continent.  



Carved out of a particularly large cavern in this sprawling network was the *Arena of Stars*, the underground stadium designed for the viewing pleasure of a select few. It was there, in this Arena of Stars, that our man of mud Johannes Walker found himself for the second time that day.



This event was quite unlike the first, however; the underground arena was now lit with electric lanterns and full of lively chatter. The ceiling was closed, the copper panels glistening dully as if they held no secret. The fighters were all here, too, bandaged tightly and girded around the waist and breast, as applicable. Fresh blood still shimmered in splattering designs along the floor and wall, but there was such a rambunctious fervor among the combatants that the scene was not unwelcoming. Many of them were excitedly recalling the clash of the preliminaries and acting out this or that parry and dodge.

With the injection having thoroughly checked the worst of his symptoms, Hahn felt like a new man. The only damper was something dark, spectral in the back of his mind, some... vague memory... or wisp of a dream... some darkness crawling beneath his skin...



But whatever it was, he couldn't grasp it fully. And so, he turned his mind to surveying the fighters.



"Quite a cast this year, eh?" commented Solianus, who had escorted him and the remaining gladiators from the medical ward. "What do you make of those minotaurs there? Should be competitive sport, don't you agree?"



Hahn eyed Solianus' profile, concerned more about his competitive sport than any minotuar and unsure of what to make of the man. He was a contender, an adversary, probably a veteran fighter, yet he smiled with the radiance of the sun to all who would behold it. Hahn felt mildly annoyed at his inability to judge the reason for Solianus' good-natured attitude towards him, and he didn't like it.

But even Hahn with his prickly nature recognized that if he set aside his cynicism -- or at least concealed it -- he might learn something valuable.



"How does a man fight a minotaur?" Hahn mused, scratching the sandy beard sprouting along his jaw. "Does it have a weakness?"

Solianus smiled. "Hold there a moment, I'll ask." And the gladiator made his way towards the big brutes.

Hahn shrugged, admittedly impressed by the simplicity of Solianus' plan and vaguely curious if it would work. In the meantime, he cast he own eyes around the crew of gladiators. The fighters were primarily male humans, of course, but Hahn was surprised by the number of females and the diversity of therianthropes present. Most of them lessers with only hints of the bestial blood, but he spotted a few greaters — a silver feline, a palomino centaur, and some kind of horned antelope. While scanning the rough and boisterous crowd, his eyes hooked on the familiar gray ears of a—

“My my my, if it isn’t Johannes Walker!”

—burro. 



“Shirilotta?” Hahn was momentarily stunned as she stalked towards him, her long ears swiveling in his direction. “What the hell are you doing here?”


“Same as you, I reckon,” she grinned. “Gonna get that prize for the clan. Pa’s got some business with the games this year, so I figure, why not? I can shoot and spar as well as any man in the Outpost, and since there’s law against killing the fighters, I’m thinkin’ the danger’s not much more than any old hunt in the wild country. Benny came along, too, but he was taken out in the prelims.”


"Now ain't that something," Hahn mumbled.



“You look like shit, Hahn, if you don’t mind me sayin’. Guess you're probably thinking about getting that prize for the Sprawlers. You heard the rumors, too? People sayin’ some kinda dragon comin’. I don’t rightly know what that means, but everyone’s on edge all the same.”



"Yeah, I heard somethin' about that," he replied, but he didn't much care to discuss the Sprawl. "Old Mennuin’s got business in Games, eh? What kind of business?”

Shirilotta smiled mysteriously and shrugged. “Money’s tight an’ you know Pa’s always got his nose to the ground for new enterprisin’.”
 

Mennuin *did* have a nose for enterprising. Hahn tried to press Shirilotta for further answers, but she evaded any kind of discussion about her pa, and so they turned their talk to recounting the preliminary fight. Somewhere on the other side of the arena, double doors opened and closed, and the air shifted in the room. A hush descended on the crowd of gladiators as an official-looking entourage established itself in the center of the arena. Lieutenant Sentariel Blackstep with two additional HAREs were among the group. Leading the entourage was some sort of... lizard?



The squat, scaly figure of a reptilian therianthrope clad in elaborate, indigo robes drew the attention of the rowdy crowd. The scales of his large, crocodilian head had a pinkish opalescence that shimmered shell-like under the lanterns, and was adorned by a gold diadem dangling with precious gems. Hahn had never seen this kind of therian, particularly one with the accoutrements of a prince.

“For thosse who do not know, I am Kessssouath Steelssskin, Illusstriouss Director of Octavia’s renowned Combat Games. Welcome to my luduss.” The crocodilian therianthrope affected a dramatic bow, spreading his arms and inclining his head. “Congratulationss on the successs of your firsst challenge. I’m ssure you’re all desssirous of resst but there iss much to cover. Pleasse now approach and collect a sstone from the bag in an orderly fasshion.”
 

To emphasize the word “orderly”, Sentariel shifted her stance and tucked her arms behind her back with her usual rigidity, the movement causing the light to glint off the shortsword hanging at her waist. Shirilotta nudged Hahn with an elbow.



“Let’s have a pact, eh? For old time’s sake. At least ‘til it’s down to you an’ I, then all bets’re off.”

She was nervous, Hahn realized. He gave a small nod. “Aye. But you gotta tell me what Mennuin’s up to.”
 

“When you have somethin’ to trade, I’ll tell you."



Once the sweaty crowd around the entourage had thinned, the pair of unlikely partners approached the bag. Hahn cast his eyes towards Sentariel, but the lupine did not meet his gaze or offer any indication of familiarity. Shirilotta grinned at the HARE holding the bag, then stuck her hand in and pulled out some kind of stone. Hahn did the same.

He moved away from the group and glanced down at the green jasper in his hand, turning it over to find some kind of rune engraved into the surface. A diagonal line with two crossing short lines. He’d never seen the symbol before, but he felt certain Jakim would know it.

Shirilotta held up her stone; it bore the same mark. 
 

“Kindly assssemble into your teamsss,” Kessouath instructed. “Trading, ssswapping, and otherwisse changing iss not permitted; violatorss will be disssqualified.”

“Got a stick with two crossing twigs!” Shirilotta called loudly, lifting her stone. “Stick ‘n crossing twigs, right here!”
 

Hahn flinched, pressing a calloused hand to his head. “Goddamn, Shira, why you gotta be such a loudmouth?”

“Stick and crossin’ twigs!” She yelled again, this time just for the effect. He supposed it saved him the trouble of walking around hunting for the group. 

It became apparent that they were divided into five groups of six fighters each. The greater feline therianthrope joined them first, his smile wide and his eyes bright. Hahn could tell right away he was an annoying one. “Stick ‘n twigs; I like it,” he commented, showing the rune on his stone. “Nice to have another therian on the team, even a lesser one. I’m Scherzo.”



Next came a large, silent human with deeply tanned skin and a rows of banded tattoos running down the lengths of his arm. He was a full head taller than Hahn and twice as wide, but his expression was as blank as fresh paper.

“Whoa, big guy,” Shirilotta commented with a hint of admiration. “Betcha didn’t even need those clubs, did ya?”


In stark contrast to the brute, they were joined by a spindly, pale man, drowning in brown robes. He was the only fighter not clad in the meager wrappings of the gladiator, and Hahn wondered at the reason for this special treatment. His face was gaunt but the flesh of his cheeks sagged slightly, as if he’d once wore extra fat there. His eyes were dark-rimmed and sunken, and his clean-shaven head and emphasized the queer contours of his pallid features. 

“And what are you, some kind of mage?” Shirilotta asked, her nose wrinkling. 

“Of a sorts,” the robed man answered softly. “My name is Sir Huxley Avanier Deloriceous Havignar the Fourth; you may address me as Sir Huxley.”

Whooping and hollering broke out around the bag as the one and only Solianus separated from the huddle of fighters. He smiled and held up his stone; sticks and twigs it was. Hahn sighed under his breath as the gladiatorial adonis approached their group.



"You our last guy?" Shirilotta called, showing him her stone.



“Just so,” he smiled, and glanced towards the silent brute. “Braxxus, I thought I spotted you in the prelims. Have you been working on your left swing?”

Braxus nodded.

“Glad you’re on my team this year, then," he remarked appreciatively, then scanned his others. “Well met, all! I’m Solianus.”



"Solianus the Lion-hearted?" Scherzo asked.



"Just so," Solianus smiled.



"Solianus the three-time champion?" Shirilotta questioned.



"Aye, just so," he said. Hahn regarded him heavily.
 

Once all of the teams were assembled, their scaly warden Kessouath went over the rules of conduct, but Hahn had other matters on his mind. His eyes were drawn to Solianus' back, analyzing him, trying to pick up any helpful information from the fighter's musculature. He didn't have many scars, nor any immediate evidence of weakness. He suspected that Solianus might be left-handed, judging from the way he gestured with his left first. It wasn't much to go on, but it was something. Kessouath informed them that they would be further subdivided into partnerships, which they would decide for themselves tomorrow. He then excused them to the barracks.



As the groups were escorted to their resting quarters, Hahn lingered behind, observing his party. Both the silver feline Scherzo and Shirilotta were quite taken with Solianus, and riddled him with questions about his previous contests, which he answered with great animation.



Sir Huxley -- as he introduced himself -- and the brute Braxxus seemed to employ the same strategy as he, recognizing that friends would eventually become enemies and maintaining their silence. Braxxus had not spoken a single word, and Hahn was beginning to wonder if he was even able.



The barracks, as it turned out, were not uncomfortable accommodations, with two neat rows of three beds and three nightstands, and a larger table and chairs at the back for congregating. The table sported a deck of cards, a pitcher of fresh water, a basket of fruit, and, laughably enough, a vase with fresh flowers. High above was a rectangular cut in the stone to let in light and air, probably at ground level, though the portal was dark now. The window was much too small to admit even a child, and barred despite that. There was a door that led to a claustrophobic water closet, featuring a single, solitary toilet. The ludus guards locked the main door so they couldn't wander, but otherwise they were left to themselves.



"Feels like a holiday," Hahn commented absently. He went through the unfamiliar room, exploring the beds (bolted to the floor), nightstand drawers (empty), and lavatory (barely large enough for a grown man), but there was nothing of particular interest. 



“You can all relax now,” Solianus said, stretching out on the cot he'd chosen with his arms behind his head. “This isn’t a prison. Enjoy yourself and you’ll get further in the Games.”



“Is that your strategy, Solianus?” Sir Huxley sneered softly.



“Just so,” Solianus returned. “It’s late and we need rest. But first, consider your partnerships; there won't be much time to decide in the morning. The first days are focused on group combat, but as the number of fighters whittle down we’ll switch to pair combat in the middle days and, finally, one-v-one. If you lose your partner early, you'll be severely disadvantaged during middles. Choose wisely.”



Silence hung in the air, but Solianus dispelled it with a laugh. “Come now, don’t look so glum! There are many strategies for choosing a partner. You could choose someone with similar strengths and skills, making your advantages even more formidable. Or you could pair with someone opposite, covering your failings. They switch up combat all the time, so there's no telling what we'll face.”
 

“Oh, are you our leader now?” Shiralotta asked, perhaps finally realizing that Solianus was her greatest threat to victory.



Solianus shrugged and rolled over in his cot, turning his back to the group. “Decide what you will; I’ll pair up with whoever doesn't have a partner. Good night.”

And within minutes, he was snoring softly. Hahn was a little jealous.



"Well! I suppose I'll start, then," Scherzo offered. He moved to the center of the room and spread his arms out in presentation of himself. The feline was full therianthrope, lean and slightly shorter than Hahn himself. His fine fur was a light gray, almost silver in the light, with hints of darker striping. His white-tipped ears flicked towards each sound, and his long tail swished behind him. “Once again, my name is Scherzo. I’m from the principality of Hawkin’s Harbor. My specialty is, as you might expect, acrobatics.” 



To illustrate this, Scherzo performed a triple somersault between the rows of beds, and flipped up to his feet. Shirilotta whistled appreciatively. 



“Impressive!” she said, and Hahn silently agreed. Acrobatics would certainly be numbered among his failings.



“Thank you, madam,” Scherzo replied with a flourishing bow. “I am also an expert at fencing, having learned from a certain infamous captain of the high seas.” He pantomimed fencing, jumping up on the end of a bed to gain the high ground over his invisible opponent. “Additionally, I’ve undergone some training as a bard but I’ve yet to gain any godspells so that is of little use in combat. If you need help sleeping, however... I may be of some service.”



“We'll keep that in mind," Shirilotta said. She then nodded towards the dark shape in the corner. "You have godspells, don’t you? Huxley, was it?”



“It is *Sir* Huxley to the common folk, if you please,” he said in his quiet, rasping voice. He made no effort to move from his shadowed corner. “That is correct; like many mages, I shall require a strong sword and shield in front of me. However I have impressive range and accuracy when it comes to taking down targets.”

Scherzo hopped off the bed next to him, undeterred by his offensive manner. “I must admit, I’ve been fascinated by mages since kittenhood. Will you tell us about your godspells, Sir Huxley? Who is your patron deity?”



But Sir Huxley only shook his head. “I've said what I will say.”
 

“Alrighty,” Scherzo shrugged, turning to Braxxus. “How about you, big guy?”



Braxxus stood still as a gargoyle, observing the scene. He looked down at Scherzo, blank-faced. Then he gripped an imaginary sword tightly with both hands, and swung it downwards. He straightened, shrugged, and folded his arms back over his chest.



“Simple. I like it,” Scherzo complimented. “And you? You’ve been awfully quiet.”

Hahn scratched his jaw, thinking. The truth was, his combat proficiency was middling at best. “I hunt. Large beasts, mostly. Livercrawlers, too. Whatever’s out there.”



“Livercrawlers?” Scherzo raised his eyebrows. “You must be a great hunter, then. Or a reckless one.”



“It pays well," he shrugged. "I use ranged weaponry; guns, particularly rifles, and hunting bows. I’ve had some experience with… ahh… brawling, I reckon.” He held up two fists to indicate. “That about sums it up.”



“My skillset is similar to Hahn’s,” Shirilotta said in turn, and Hahn noticed Scherzo’s head tilt slightly at the nickname. “Rifles, dagger combat, some swordplay. Satyrs, as you may know, aren't known for combat skills. But what I bring to a partnership is…. *information*.”



That single word hooked every person in the room, save the snoring Solianus, and Shirilotta smiled with relish.



“I’m a guard from Mennuin’s Outpost -- my whole life I’ve seen all nature of folk. Therianthropes, humans, warriors, mages, and races you can’t fathom. I’ve hosted fighters from all Twelve Tribes and had drunken mercenaries from every corner spill their secrets. And…”



She glanced at each of them in turn.



“My Pa’s helpin’ the Games Committee organize the trials, so I may or may not have information on some of the events. For my *partner*,” she said pointedly in Hahn’s direction.



Ahh, so that’s how it was.



“Well, that’s certainly a valuable asset,” Scherzo nodded, then yawned. “May I suggest we convene for now and ‘sleep on it’, as they say? Who knows what the morrow has in store.”



Hahn was not satisfied with the conclusion of the conversation, but his brain and body were desperately demanding rest. As the others shuffled and murmured around the room, he took a page from Solianus’ book and rolled over, pulling the delightfully clean blanket over himself. He was typically a “sleep-with-one-eye-open” type of guy, but there was no energy for vigilance tonight. He had the comfort of knowing his teammates wouldn't want anyone dispatched when unknown trials and hardships lurked around the corner.



And as far as the partnerships went... well, Hahn didn't have an answer for that conundrum. Solianus was too dangerous to partner with, of that he was convinced. The champion was smart, proficient, and watchful... he's certainly gathering information on each of them. Why else would he spend his time in the medical ward?



He knew what to expect from Shirilotta, and he trusted her about as well as any. She had information that was undoubtedly valuable, and he had questions that extended beyond the Games. But she was primarily a ranged fighter, like him, and so their partnership would be unbalanced. Neither were experts in melee weaponry.



Braxxus was obviously a powerful fighter, and he’d been in the Games before. He seemed like a straight-forward companion, as far as Hahn could estimate, and his strength was Hahn’s shortcoming. His presumed inability to talk could be a problem, however, and his simplicity would be quickly evident to their opponents. Solianus knew Braxxus, too, and had presumably bested him in prior Games.



If it was a wild card he wanted, Sir Huxley was that. Hahn did love wild cards, and there was certainly something enticing about unknown godspells. He had no idea of Huxley’s capabilities, nor his limitations. He’d met a mage previously, though, and knew the more powerful their godspells, the weaker their physical bodies. He’d have the liability of protecting Huxley during combat, but…. since Hahn was a ranged combatant, perhaps that wasn’t the worst match.



Now Scherzo was athletic, far more than he, and he had a feeling the feline would be a formidable melee combatant due to his speed and flexibility. Hahn suspected he was quick in more than his feet, too. Scherzo's senses could be incredibly useful in the field and, paired with a ranged gunner they might make a deadly combination. Assuming Hahn was allowed the option of guns -- that was a pretty big *if*.



Not knowing what trials lay ahead made it impossible to logically deduce the correct course, but there it was… the cards were face-up on the table, and Hahn had to pick one up.

He thought of these things as the room settled into stillness, the other fighters taking up their rest. And as his mind drifted, his eyes fell on the room's solitary window. It revealed the most serene picture of the night sky, twinkling with celestial bodies outside of mankind's reach. And for reasons he couldn't quite comprehend, the image stirred an eerie, ominous sensation deep in his soul. His blood ran cold in his veins, and the memory of salt touched his tongue.



There, far beyond the rectangular portal, was a lonely violet star, pulsing gently against the velvet darkness.
