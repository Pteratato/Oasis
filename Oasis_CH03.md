## Chapter 3: The Skulled Crow

*Hahn,*  
*I met a man and Im going with him. You and I had our life together, but I cant stay here anymore. I cant stay with you. This man will take care of us and the baby. The babys not right. I have to find a doctor. I dont want to be with you. Please dont try to find me. Our girl will die here and I can’t bear that. Please think of her.*  
*-Anna*


Hahn’s hand clenched around a fistful of Jakim’s shirt, and he heaved the sleeping coyote from his bed and slammed him against the wall, knocking over a shelf and sending ink bottles skittering across the dirt floor. The therianthrope lashed back before he knew what was happening, snarling and fighting against the unexpected aggression, clawing at the arm keeping him pinned.

*“What the fuck is this!?”* Hahn shouted, holding up a crumpled piece of paper with Anna’s disjointed, childlike scrawl. *“Who the fuck is he!?”*

“Hahn! Get your goddamn hands off me!” Jakim growled back, slamming his fist into Hahn’s abdomen and forcing the air from his lungs. Hahn gasped and released the coyote, but rapidly recovered and struck a heavy blow against Jakim’s jaw. Jakim crumbled against the wall but he knew every second counted. He threw his weight into Hahn’s chest and they both staggered back, falling into a makeshift bed of plastic crates that crumbled under the blow. They fell into a chaotic pile of sheets and crates and fists and snarls, each trying to get the upper hand on the other.

“Stop fighting!” Brimjrar cried desperately from the other side of the room, but his voice seemed far away, unable to penetrate the conflict. “Both of you, stop!”

“*Where’s my wife?*” Hahn snarled as they struggled among the bedding and overturned crates. He had the upper hand in brute strength, but Jakim was quick and precise, making him formidable even against the hunter’s wild fury. Jakim evaded as long as he could, but it wasn’t long before Hahn managed to pin the coyote beneath his greater weight.

“You said you would protect them!” the enraged Hahn shouted, smashing his fist into Jakim’s jaw. “Where is she!?”

“Fuck if I know!” Jakim shouted back, spitting a mouthful of blood. He slammed a knee into Hahn’s groin and the hunter recoiled in pain. The coyote was up in an instant and landed a solid punch into Hahn’s face, holding back nothing.

Hahn rolled back into the crates and this time, Jakim didn’t give him the chance to recover. He was over Hahn now, punching him, and even when he felt blood – his and Hahn’s – he didn’t stop.

“Goddamnit, Hahn!” Jakim shouted, punching him again and again. “Fuck you!”

Through the haze of desperation and adrenaline, it took Jakim a moment to realize Hahn wasn’t fighting back. The coyote stopped with his fist still poised, his jaw clenched tightly and his chest heaving as he stared down dangerously at his companion.

And Hahn stared back up at him blankly, blood matting his short beard, his arms out to the side, defenseless. He just stared, his blue eyes momentarily empty, the well of wrath depleted.

Jakim was tempted to keep punching.

“What the hell’s wrong with you,” Jakim growled coldly, turning his head and spitting more blood into the dirt. Slowly, he lowered his fist and pulled back, sitting next to the prone form of the hunter. Breathing heavily, he touched his split temple and hissed at the sting. He noticed absently that Brims was nowhere to be seen, but that was probably for the better.

Hahn sat up. He passed Jakim the note from Anna, then pulled out a cigarette from the crumpled pack.

Jakim read the note with difficulty, no better at reading than Anna was at writing. He put the note down and, for a moment, there was nothing either of them could say. Hahn took a deep drag from his cigarette, then offered it to Jakim, who accepted it and took a puff.

The hunter slowly exhaled a long stream of smoke through his nose, the action soothing in its own way. He stared at the lit end of the cigarette, where the glowing ash was speckled with little salt-like gleams of violet. 

“Shit’s s’posed to make you sterile,” he said, not for the first time since Anna’s second unexpected pregnancy. “What’s the goddamn point.”

Jakim said nothing, leaving empty space for Hahn to fill, if he chose.

“I tried to get her to…”

*Terminate*. 

The word hung in the air between them, unspoken; they both knew Jakim could hear the domestic disputes one shack over.

“But she couldn’t do it back then, and can’t do it now. I thought Jae was a one-off, a miracle. Guess no matter what you do, if you keep shootin’ long enough you’ll find a loaded chamber.”

“What’re you gonna do?” Jakim asked finally.

Hahn considered this a moment, his pale eyes fixed on the cigarette in his hand. He thought long and hard, but there were no easy answers.

“...I might be a shit dad…” he said carefully, taking another long drag. He passed it to Jakim again and stood, fixing his clothes. “Might be a shit dad but I’m not gonna let my kid fall into their hands.”

Octavia was not a slave nation in the manner of Sobretses, but *they* were a vague and pernicious evil, unconfined by borders or laws, and *they* would take whomever they pleased, for whatever purposes they saw fit, and few could stop them. 

“They will not take my son,” he said again, and his eyes were no longer empty.

“Well… and about our pharos…” Jakim ventured, “...unless we plan to stick to the Wall like barnacles forever, we need a specialist. I can’t fix it.”

“So it’s settled, then. We break into Octavia, get my son, and kidnap an engineer on the way out. Then we can finally be rid of this godforsaken hellhole. Maybe go somewhere we can make into a real home.” 

---

Dawn spread her frosted fingertips over the Sprawl, again whispering promises of cold on the horizon. Somewhere, a dog barked nonstop, and in the distance wagons rattled to life, but the humble town was primarily silent. 

Jakim and Hahn found Brimjrar huddled in the corner of Anna’s shack, crying softly into his arms. He didn’t understand what was happening, and the threat of his happy home breaking apart shook him to his core.

Jakim soothed his brother with hopeful, cajoling words, and knowing that the best way to distract Brims was with a task, sent him off to the junkyard to find batteries. 

With that accomplished, Hahn and Jakim set about prospecting the Sprawlers for whatever information they could uncover. The hunter was calm now, but Jakim watched him carefully, keenly aware that he was now the only one capable of checking Hahn’s unpredictable temperament.

Hahn cloaked his intentions in the guise of regular, post-hunt business, which he typically conducted after returning to the Sprawl. He ensured that the prey they’d brought back had been properly butchered, and the meat separated, packaged, and preserved as it should be. He paid the appropriate individuals their due from the money collected at the Outpost, and he delivered supplies he’d purchased to their respective establishments. While he did these things, he slipped in a few extra questions, made a little more conversation than usual, and gleaned what he could.

Jakim told Hahn about the priest, and the information made the hunter’s skin crawl.

He and Jakim weren’t leaders, per se, but due to the nature of their roles – one to provide meat and the other to maintain their defenses – they had a level of authority within the Sprawl that was unmatched. Even the surliest of Sprawlers begrudgingly obliged questions from Hahn – or risked losing their meat rations – and the pair of them were able to join breakfast circles in any corner of the Sprawl.

At first, the Sprawlers were enthusiastic in welcoming Hahn, congratulating him on a successful hunt and tithing cooked foods and other useful items. But as Hahn continued digging deeper, their demeanors became uneasy, and they glanced aside.

*’Something’s coming for them.’* 

The Sprawlers said in hushed tones.

*’The wasting dragon.’*

Yet none could say what that meant, and when pressed their superstitions ran wild. *It* was coming to devour their children, they said. *It* was a monster, a massive livercrawler immune to Suprex. *It* was a merciless winter, and it would freeze everything in solid ice, turning them into white corpses. *It* was a consumptive fever from Tzorim, which would cause the skin to peel from the body as if flayed alive.

Few recalled anything about a soft-spoken priest with ginger hair, but a couple of them did notice some children missing. At first, it was a curiosity; many of the absent kids were orphaned or disowned, but earned their keep doing chores and simple labors around the Sprawl. A missing kid was nothing new, especially after a visit from foreigners, but late into the morning many Sprawlers found their trash hadn’t been collected, and water hadn’t been brought in, and the animals hadn’t been fed, and it was then that they started asking questions. 

Almost a half-dozen kids, mostly strays, hadn’t turned out for morning chores or collected their breakfast. By noon even Hahn’s hardened soul was thoroughly unsettled, and he still hadn’t discovered anything about the priest.

“Ahhh, the Father Ydranna!” an old crone squawked from the door of her hut, overhearing Hahn’s inquiries nearby. “What a nice young man, ‘e was.”

Hahn turned to her, his eyes narrowing but his voice supplicating. “What’s that now, Nem? You spoke to this guy?”

“Yes, yes! Collected ‘is ‘orse, I did!” the withered old Nem responded, hobbling over to Hahn. She dipped her head conspiratorially, eager to ladle out the gossip. “He came back for Hobbes near mornin’, I says to her, she could do a lot worse!”

Nem emitted a shrill, barking laughter, and Hahn cut her off impatiently. “What else do you remember? Anything.”

“Hmm….” she hummed, relishing this moment of having something the great *Johannes Walker* coveted. But she knew his temper, and didn’t draw it out long. “He was traveling the ‘ighroad with a fancy caravan, some hoity folk, ‘an ‘e left ‘em to come along the bonfire. We stabled his ‘orse and ‘e went along, that’s all. Got some coppers, we did. Fine lookin’ man, near thirty if I ‘ad ta wager, orange hair and freckles, green eyes, nice smile. Didn’t see ‘im again, reckon I’m too old to tickle ‘is *fancy*!”

“And did Hobbes… entertain this priest?”

“Says she didn’t, but ‘e paid her anyways,” Nem shrugged, then jerked a thumb towards a little alley that wrapped around the side of the hut. “Ask yerself.”

Young girls were not Hahn’s preferred demographic, especially with his face busted up, but he sighed and thanked Nem for the information. She badgered him a moment, coughing theatrically, until he finally tipped the old crone a copper, then he headed around the hut to talk to Hobbes. In all his years of being a Sprawler, he’d only interacted with the girl twice, and he did his best to mentally pack away the severity of what he was carrying, softening his expression as best as he could. Jakim chuckled at his plight and offered to talk to the girl on his behalf.

“Your face don’t look any better than mine,” Hahn grumbled.

“And whose fault is that?”

Behind the hut, a twelve-year-old girl was seated on an old chair patching a pair of trousers. She glanced up as the two men approached, her eyes widening and her posture wilting. Hahn tried to smile, but it wasn’t very convincing.

“Hey, lass, don’t worry now,” he soothed. “I just wanna talk, you don’t even have to get up. Hobbes, is it?”

Hahn pulled up a chair in front of the girl and sat down, leaning forward on his elbows to keep the conversation between them. Jakim turned away obligingly, meandering through a little garden as if interested in the herbs. Warily, Hobbes looked back and forth between them.

“Old Nem says that priest came to get you last night, that true?” Hahn asked as gently as he could. 

Hobbes hesitated, then nodded.

“Did he want to–” Hahn started, then checked his vulgarity and tried again. “Did he try to…. take you to bed…?”

Hobbes shook her head vigorously, cheeks reddening.

“What did he want, then?”

Hobbes made some motions with her hands, pointing to herself and holding up two fingers, then making a motion at her neck of a priest’s collar and holding up two fingers from her other hand. Then she put both sets of two fingers on her lap and made the motion of them walking together. She lifted a hand and pointed in the direction of the Outer Wall. 

“He wanted to take you into Octavia?”

She nodded.

“Why?”

This question caused her to pause. She looked down at her lap, fingering the fabric of the trousers she was mending. Finally, she shrugged. 

“Nem said he paid you, is that true?”

Hobbes nodded and slipped a hand into the pocket of her dress. She pulled out some kind of coin, handing it to Hahn, and he knew immediately it hadn’t been intended as payment – at least, it wasn’t any kind of currency accepted around these parts. He thanked her and gave her a couple of coppers.

Hahn rose and Jakim rejoined him silently, the two heading back in the direction of Knob Nook. The coyote waited until they were out of earshot before inquiring what Hahn had discovered.

“They’re taking the kids into Octavia,” Hahn replied. They’d both kind of assumed that much, but it was good to have confirmation.

“*They*?”

Hahn held up the coin, showing Jakim the skulled crow sigil stamped into the metal. “Think your ex-boyfriend’s back to stir up trouble?”

Jakim stopped, his expression surprised at first, then darkening. Finally, he shrugged nonchalantly and resumed walking.

"Doubt it,” he answered quietly. “The Serbanescu clan’s growin’ their numbers these days, could be anyone."

“Crowfolk don’t just wander into the Sprawl,” Hahn replied, but let the matter drop.

---

“Okay, but what I don’t understand is,” Brimjrar was saying, making small gestures with his hands, “why would the kids leave *before* breakfast?”

“Shut up, Brims,” Hahn snapped, but there was no real bite to it.

The three of them were inside the ‘junkhouse’, which was what they called the ramshackle building behind Jakim’s shack, smaller than either of their homes but better protected with sheet metal walls. The junkhouse had no windows, just a single electric lantern, so it was perpetually dim and dusty with all the crap they had scavenged over the years.

At the center of the junkhouse, taking up almost the entire square footage of it, was their *pharos*.

It was small as far as pharoi go, about the height of two grown men stacked, and was built into a motorized metal cart. The side panels of the lighthouse were removed, exposing the wires and glowing Suprex tubes inside. Everything seemed to be connected and undamaged, but there was one problem.

It didn’t work.

The motor car was of no consequence; the whole apparatus was certainly heavy, but they could pull it manually if they had to. But if the lighthouse itself didn’t work, it was useless.

Hahn and Jakim were the closest things the Sprawl had to engineers, but the technology was highly specialized and neither had any experience with lighthouses beyond refilling Suprex reservoirs. And Mennuin wouldn’t let them so much as *sniff* the lighthouse at the outpost; Hahn suspected they didn’t have a specialist, either.

Jakim was seated at a small table, turning the crow token around and around. He ran a hand through his dark dreadlocks and sighed. “Well, now what?”

Hahn scratched absently at the beard sprouting around his jaw.

“Way I figure it,” he began, turning away from the pharos and walking over to the table, “we got a few options. We could travel up the highroad a few miles and ambush a wagon.”

“Kill someone and take their cart?” Brims asked in alarm.

“We’d still need papers to get in,” Jakim said.

“You could pass as a merchant from Mhashtra,” Hahn responded. “The old IDs don’t have pictures.”

“And what’re you gonna pass as? My slave?”

Hahn crossed his arms, unconsciously drawing himself up to his full height. “Never was good at the role,” he answered, then smirked. “But I’ll do what it takes.”

“Are we seriously gonna kill people?” Brims asked again. “C’mon, there has to be another way.”

“Festival means bloodsports, we could get in as arena fighters,” Hahn ventured. “But we’d be inside the city with no papers. And we’d still end up killing people, just… legally.”

“Brims would be slaughtered, and I’m not leaving him here,” Jakim answered. “What about the militia? They’re always recruiting for the wall guard, and we’d have papers.”

“*Fuck that*,” Hahn spat venomously. “I’d fight in the goddamn *pit* before putting on some goddamn leash again.”

“But the wall guard would be perfect for Brims, and we’d be able to get information to and from the Sprawl,” Jakim reasoned, unperturbed by the outburst. “If the rumors are true and something is coming… we may not have time to slink around Octavia without papers.”

“*You* can join the fucking guard,” Hahn growled. “Who knows how long the recruitment process would take – bloodsports are faster. The have-alls gotta get their rocks off somehow.”

“Maybe we should split up, then. Take two paths, better odds one of ‘em gets us there. But it’s risky; we’ll be on our own if there’s trouble.”

The trio fell into a contemplative silence, weighing their options.
