## Chapter 1: The Hunt


Sick, sweet, rancid milk. 

Johannes’ nose curled at the stench of it, faint but clear. He couldn’t see his quarry yet, but that odor was unmistakable. Downwind from him; one, perhaps two. Parasitic livercrawlers, oleander subtype; *Apocarnididaea Nerium*.

*Finally.*

He shifted his gun, an old but well-loved bolt-action rifle, and stepped quietly through the brush. He was not a small man – lean from years of rationing, but tall and strong – and his heavy boots crunched the twigs and drying leaves. Hahn didn’t particularly care if he was heard; he’d left the hunting party, so any carelessness just meant a more entertaining hunt for him.

*Let ‘em come.*

The hunt was his home, more than any other place in existence. More than his modest hut with the comforts of food and fire. More than his bed, with the warmth of his wife next to him. More than the community he’d helped build, poor but functioning, full of death and life dancing together in a perpetual waltz of nature versus the human spirit. Winter would bring that waltz to its crescendo, and the game he brought home would determine how many lives witnessed the spring. The hunting wagon was full this trip, bursting with elk and plump hares and squirrels and packs and packs of herbs and edible grasses – all very auspicious – and he’d sent it safely ahead so he could pursue one final prey. 

The brush parted into a wide clearing, and Johannes lowered himself slowly into a crouch, lifting the scope of his rifle. 

A large boar staggered through the grasses in the ravine, stumbling unnaturally, its brain and body overridden by a parasite capable of animating long-dead corpses. This parasite wrapped around the boar’s body in a prison of green vines, emerging from a hole in the creature’s underside and slithering through the dark fur, digging into and out of every orifice. Gorgeous sunset flowers bloomed out of the boar’s back, and that coveted milk dripped from its underside, trailing its stench through the grasses.

The flowers called to Johannes most, tempting him with their folds and colors, a seductive promise. But the milk… *that* was the real money-maker.

The rifle barrel followed the unsuspecting creature as it waded around the brush, waiting, waiting…

Hahn fired and squeals of alarm ripped through the trees, the creature emitting shrill imitations of a pain it couldn’t possibly feel. It thrashed about in wild, frantic motions, but there was no escaping the onslaught of bullets. The deadly efficacy of each shot brought a smile to Hahn’s lips, each vibration of the gun a dopamine rush through his body, each *Suprex*-coated bullet ripping through the boar like a knife through butter, sending it into panicked seizures. The nerium parasite, repelled by the toxic effect of the Suprex, made a valiant effort to retract all the vines back inside the carcass of the boar, and its retreat from the animal’s central nervous system cost it what meager ambulatory ability it had possessed. The boar fell over into the grasses, milkweed sap oozing from the bullet holes, as the fatal combination of Johannes’ accuracy and the debilitating Suprex pierced the heart of the nerium. The parasite’s vines tightened up briefly, then relaxed and fell around the corpse of the boar. Silence stretched outward from the scene. 

There was a moment of stillness; nothing moved. 

Only when he was assured the fight was won did Hahn lower his rifle. As he approached the boar, his eyes caught on the dead sockets of the animal, writhing now with insects. 

He lingered on this sight a moment; imagining his own icy eyes crawling with biting flies, imagining the warm brown eyes of his wife and his son thick with larvae. The thought churned his stomach and yet he continued to gaze into it, unblinking, searing the vision into his soul.

Then as quickly as the dismal fantasy had come, it was gone.

Johannes propped his rifle against a boulder and set about his work with practiced efficiency. He produced from his pack a kit designed for this kind of harvesting, and he opened it to reveal the gleaming instruments within; various sizes of scalpels and medical scissors, reinforced pouches and lined vials, with other helpful miscellany; alchemist gloves, labels, tweezers, and the like. The kit had cost him more than he cared to admit, but *God*, did it make the job easier and faster.

The boar’s meat was useless now, half-rotted and infested with insects, but the milkweed sap… *that* was the real motivation for braving the dangers of the livercrawlers. One vial of it carried enough bartering power to supply the Sprawl with several commodities through the winter; salt, coffee, grains, and most importantly of all – Suprex.

He pruned the leaves and the flowers on the outside, then he hefted over the boar and slid the scalpel along the stomach, opening the skin and tissue to expose the organs within. The stomach was knotted up with roots and vines and dripping milksap, and Hahn grabbed these firmly and pulled them out. Along these roots were violet fungi, little mushroom symbiotes hitching a ride. Hahn cut them from the roots and slid them into a pouch. 

Harvesting the milksap was tougher – the nerium’s central ganglia was buried in the boar’s liver, hence the moniker *livercrawler* – but Hahn was no stranger to the task and excised the organ carefully. He held the liver in one hand and used a scalpel to make a thin slice, then carefully squeezed the contents into several of the available vials. He could feel the bulbous parasite that had taken up residence inside the liver, and though he knew the nerium was dead, his heart pumped a little faster. 

The milksap that filled the vials was a nice, creamy white, with only traces of fluids from the boar remaining. Good; it would still require an alchemist to distill, but the purer the milksap the higher the bounty it would fetch. 

Hahn packed the contaminated equipment into a sealed pouch and pulled off the thick gloves. And then his favorite part, the final step of the ritual; he plucked the last remaining flower from the butchered boar, saved just for him, his little reward. He popped that delicate blossom into his mouth, grinding it slowly between his teeth, savoring the nectar, a comfort as warm and relaxing as a waiting lover.

Then he glanced towards the horizon where the sun was low and, in a habitual motion, rubbed the back of his neck. His sandy hair hid a rippling patch of burned, scarred skin, and he rubbed it the way one might rub a riverstone for luck, a silent prayer for a safe journey onward.

Johannes stood and slung his pack over his shoulder, reclaimed his rifle, and began the trek to Mennuin’s Outpost.


---


*Mennuin’s the place to be,*  
*For beer and Suprex and tea,*  
*And knives and ammo and fleas,*  
*Mennuin’s the place to be.*

Johannes arrived at Mennuin’s Outpost just as darkness was settling over the region, and the bright color of the outpost’s many neon signs and relatively short *pharos* provided a beacon for all weary travelers. The Suprex lighthouse burned an oil that was easily identifiable as vaguely sweet and vaguely rotten, but most thought of it as the smell of *safety*, a pungent repellent for all livercrawlers. 

A functioning pharos was a requirement for any encampment hoping to survive nightfall.

But even with the lighthouse emitting its repellent fumes, Mennuin’s was still surrounded by a tall wall of piecemeal sheet metal and barbed wire, designed for a different kind of monster – the bipedal kind.

It was Shirilotta on guard today – Johannes recognized her silhouette easily against the neon backdrop and, as he approached, he could even make out the sly smile that spread across her lips.

“Aha! I thought you’d be along soon, there, Hahn,” she shouted down at him, her long ears swiveling in his direction. “Spotted yer convoy headin’ off– looked like a full haul, can’t believe they didn’ stop to share a spot with us fine folk!”

Shira, as they called her, was an equiline therianthrope – not the tall, long-legged, graceful type of equine, but the short and stumpy kind, from a clan of burros. A donkey satyr; her upper body was human except the tall, swiveling ears and the wild mane of gray hair, but her lower body curved into the hind legs and cloven hooves of the burro. She was short even by the standards of her race, but what made her formidable was the glint in her eye, the sternness of her voice, and the neon glinting off of the barrel of her weapon.

“Gotta get back an’ prep the Sprawl ‘fore the caravans come through,” Johannes called back, but they both knew the lie in his words. They stared at each other for a moment, Shira staring down at him from atop the guard post, rifle lowered but ready in her hand, and Hahn staring up at her from the base of the wall, mirroring her stance with his rifle lowered, but in hand. There was respect between them, but respect was not the same as trust.

“Ahh, get on in here, you,” she said finally, and cranked the lever to lift the heavy gate. “Pa’s waitin’ for ya at the shop.”

Mennuin’s Outpost was almost as old as Octavia herself, a place for traders and monster-hunters to exchange wares and pick up basic supplies. It was a ramshackle, make-shift sort of encampment, situated away from the arid forest in a steppe of dry grasslands. It was dusty and crude and every surface was spray-painted with graffiti, but it was the only place to find certain goods. Mechanical parts, in particular, were very difficult to find, and Mennuin himself had a passion for it and went to great lengths to fund expeditions as far as the Sobretses desert to harvest broken parts of machinery. Occasionally they even managed to assemble some sort of functioning vehicle, more valuable than a chest of diamonds here among the outlanders.

Motorized vehicles and aircraft were prohibited for non-governmental usage, but laws were rarely given much thought this far from any walled metropolis.

The outpost was as lively as ever, sporting a small cluster of shacks not dissimilar from the ones in the Sprawl. There was a large tavern that spewed bawdry music and shouts, a string of shops – leatherworking, blacksmithing, poultices, and the like – and even a quaint little chapel. The chapel was more of a clinic than a place of worship, but the outposters evidently had some respect for the sanctity of the church, as it was the only building not spray-painted with skulls and neon flames.

The occupants of Mennuin’s little village were mostly therianthropes, although there was no shortage of humans as well. Many of these were outlanders and nomadic beastkin from tribes occupying the steppes and mountains, and these outlanders came to Mennuin’s for many reasons – provisions, information, as a pit-stop on a longer journey, or to hire bounty hunters and mercenaries. But, predominantly, Mennuin’s Outpost was populated by the squat, short-tempered burros and similar satyr kin. 

Johannes liked the Burro Clan; they were roughshod rogues who didn’t bathe nearly as often as they should, but they were a real salt-of-the-earth group who’d cheat you out of everything you own and save your ass from a livercrawler in the same night. He could respect that more than the humans who would never deign to cheat, but would turn a blind eye to men being eaten alive outside city walls.

The largest building was *Mennuin’s General Store*, and outside the general store were many individual stalls hawking various wares, from tobacco to woven jewelry to baked goods to *”tobacco”* to hand lanterns to grilled frog skewers. The stall owners and patrons were making the last bargains and closing up for the night, so Johannes exchanged a couple of boiled eggs for a frog skewer and headed into the general store.

Father Barrabas, a dark-skinned, aging priest, was sitting at a writing desk just inside the door, which was comically small for the man and probably designed for primary school children. He was copying some sort of book into a second, blank one, but he glanced up when Johannes entered.

“Hahn!” He called up in a thick accent. “What news from Octavia?”

“Ah, same ole shit. I’m startin’ to think they don’ like us very much,” Johannes grumbled in mock hurt. “So much for that famed Octavian sense of charity for all, eh, Father? Workin’ on a lil something might help us, though – could be our ticket to freedom.”

“Ahhh,” rumbled the priest with a chuckle. He was wrinkled from long days in the sun, but strong in body and mind, and his voice caught on the rocks in his chest. “Where ya gonna head next? Outland’s not gonna be an easy place to make a livin’.”

Johannes shrugged nonchalantly. “Octavia ain’t gonna open up, no reason to stay. Maybe we’ll move out here and be neighbors. Janus an’ I’re both handy with mechanics, ‘n you know the pups are a fan of y’all.”

Father Barrabas smiled sincerely, as if the thought was truly a welcome one. Mennuin’s Outpost was left alone by the Octavian government on the stipulation that it did not expand, though, so they both knew that this proposed scenario was an unlikely one.

Johannes left Barrabas and walked down the main aisle of the general store, casting his eyes all around the establishment and chewing on the grilled frog. The aisles were full of preserved foodstuffs, mostly canned and jarred, but there were many rows of practical items; nails and hand-tools, lanterns, rope, and the like. Hanging along the walls were such a wide array of trophies; everything from mechanical parts to taxidermied livercrawlers to provocative paintings of beautiful bodies. Most of it was familiar, but one never did know what they might find at the general store, so he scanned all the same. Johannes tucked the used skewer into a shelf of canned beans as he passed. 

“Mennuin, ya hairy ass!” Johannes greeted when he reached the long counter, laughing at his own joke that Mennuin was, quite literally, a hairy ass. “I gotcha something a lil’ extra special today.”

“Ho, boy, what you sayin’ now?”

Large, gray ears appeared from behind the counter where the burro was stooped over, organizing receipts. He was an old beastkin and about half the height of Johannes, but the strength of five humans rested in his muscled arms, riddled with bright tattoos very similar to the graffiti on his shop. His gray mane was shaved along the sides and fashioned in a tall mohawk, spray-painted with stripes in an almost glowing yellow. Some may be tempted to tease Mennuin for his loud aesthetic, but his thick biceps and rippling pectorals were usually enough to discourage it, if his influence alone wasn’t.

“Got somethin’, ya say?”

Johannes set his pack on the counter and pulled out a small, wrapped music box, broken but with all of the mechanical parts present. Mennuin’s eyes immediately lit up.

“Ah-hah-hah! Let me see!”

Johannes and Mennuin bantered over the music box for a while, and after Johannes felt the burro was properly warmed over, they bartered over the milksap and harvested components. Once those were appraised in a way which was a compromise to both and a satisfaction to neither, the pair haggled over the goods Johannes would take back to the Sprawl with him. They were at it late into the evening, long after the shop closed for the night. Once all the haggling was done, the prices decided, and the bags loaded up, they switched to the warmer discussions of exchanging news and tales over beer. Neither considered the other a friend, per se, but they each appreciated gossip and a good story, and each provided those for the other. 

Once they’d exhausted every bit of news, Mennuin allowed Johannes the use of his storage shack for the night. It was fitted with a cot just for such occasions, and Johannes was always pleased to take up the offer. He might swipe an extra couple cans of tomatoes from the stock, maybe a pack of nails, and maybe Mennuin knew this, but their business relationship was valuable and Johannes wouldn’t jeopardize that with short-sighted greed, and Mennuin knew that as well.

Johannes settled into the hard, itchy cot and tucked his arms behind his head. He stared up at the small, barred ventilation window towards the top of the shack, moonlight streaming inside. He was surrounded by canned food and junk, moth-eaten leather, and the musty smell of mildew. He was pretty sure there were mites in his cot, and the thin sheet was not near enough to protect from the coolness of the autumn night. But Johannes was not uncomfortable here.

He closed his eyes and thought of his family; his wife Anna, and their little son Jae. The situation for the Sprawl was precarious for all of them, and they all felt something uncanny on the horizon, something dark and creeping that they couldn’t quite identify. Was the threat of winter? Was it some unconscious instinct of a harsh season, something promised in the wind, maybe? \
 \
But in this moment, after the success of a bountiful hunt and bags full of supplies, with the waning relaxation of the flower still working its way through his system, and the smell of Suprex in the air, things didn’t seem too bad.
